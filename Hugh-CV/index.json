Zotero is fairly straight forward but occasionally there are complexities. This is a guide to those \u0026ldquo;more complex\u0026rdquo; situations.\n If you need a more basic introduction to Zotero and various workflows associated with using the tool, consider this video introduction.  Zotero  Zotero is an open source application (software) which is useful when tracking resource during a research project. It especially excels when it comes time to add references and citations to documents.\nZotero is especially useful when an author works with the same references between publisher styles. In these cases, it is important to correctly input the data into Zotero\u0026rsquo;s records so that the data can be correctly displayed across publisher styles.\nCitation Style Language  Citation Style Language (CSL) is the technology tool that Zotero uses to create references and citations (within a document) which comply with a style guide or publisher\u0026rsquo;s style sheet requirements.\nThe Zotero Record\u0026rsquo;s User Interface Zotero\u0026rsquo;s user interface is fairly straight forward. However, some materials when referenced need some additional fields which are not directly contained within the User Interface (UI). The following image shows the main editing location within Zotero for editing a Zotero record.\n  A blank Zotero record in Zotero version 5.0.96.2. Credit: Hugh Paterson III    Subject Materials Used This guide usually makes examples from the literature of linguistics. However, it also use direct examples from Manuals of Style such as APA 6th (Citation: VandenBos,\u0026#32; 2010) VandenBos,\u0026#32; G.\u0026#32; (2010). \u0026#32;Publication manual of the American Psychological Association (6th). \u0026#32; American Psychological Association.

The complex situations in this guide are often examples of materials sourced from an archive.\nExternal Documentation There are several helpful locations for finding out more about the inner workings of Zotero. These can be helpful when considering what a Zotero field is supposed to mean or contain and how it is exported into CSL-JSON.\n  Zotero\u0026rsquo;s page explaining the fields they have and their intended use. A mapping of Zotero fields to CSL. CSL documentation of Types and Variables and their intended use, as well as new item types proposed for CSL version 1.0.2.  Citation Style Building Datasets In addition to informing authors on some functional practices related to the crafting of Zotero records, those who wish to create a style sheet which implements a specific publisher\u0026rsquo;s specification1 or for some other specific use may benefit from some of the datasets this project has created. These datasets propagate the data through the specified style so that the author of the style sheet can check for errors.\n  ItemTypeTestData (Created by Hugh Paterson III)  jurism_style_test_items (Created by Frank Bennett)  Test items used to test APA CSL development (Created by Brenton M Wiernik)  References   (2019)  \u0026#32; (2019). \u0026#32;Publication manual of the American psychological association (7th). \u0026#32; American Psychological Association.

Zotero has a conceptual model for how its components fit together at the software level, libraries have conceptual models on how they build library records and catalogues, archives have conceptual models for how they organize artifacts, and style sheets and publishing guides have conceptual models for how they would like items to be referenced.\nScholars increasingly are apt to reference with more specificity. This is a good thing, it helps fellow scholars to find the exact evidence which was consulted during an investigation. I propose that by understanding conceptual models that libraries use to relate various kinds of records and their associated artifacts, we can make more informed and clearer, reference patterns in our scholarly documents.\nHow does a Library Record Model help us? The question has been put forth: \u0026ldquo;How does a library science model really help us with crafting good references?\u0026rdquo; and critics are correct to point out that they are different and mostly seek to do different things.

That is, am I referencing the whole conceptual \u0026ldquo;work\u0026rdquo; such as Beethoven\u0026rsquo;s 9th symphony, or am I referencing a specific item (instance/manifestation) of that work (such as the performace by the Oslo Philharmonic on the 4th of January 2019), or something in between (such as the score of a particular movement within the symphony, by a particular publisher)? Understanding how the different parts are linked together can help us make sure we have all the information necessary for anyone who might seek to follow our trail.\nBasic Model and terminology So what library model do I find most useful? Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records. It is a model that gained tracktion in the 1990\u0026rsquo;s and has evolved to become a component of the modern library cataloguing rules called Resource Description \u0026amp; Access.   Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records model of class 1 entities Credit: Hugh Paterson III    As a fairly straight forward model FRBR, has the power to force users of the model to ask questions like: \u0026ldquo;am I dealing with two expressions of the same work\u0026rdquo;, or \u0026ldquo;am I dealing with two manifestations of the same expression\u0026rdquo;, or even \u0026ldquo;am I dealing with two different works\u0026rdquo;?\nAs scholars and authors we constantly need to ask ourselves: Is the resource I am refernecing a one-of-a-kind resource or is it general resource for which there are many items (copies)? That is, am I referencing a specific copy or a generally available resource. We then also need to ask if we are attributing the right contributors to a work. FRBR can help us with both of these kinds of questions.\nFor example, if we consider the case of academic works which often include pre-prints, journal articles, and Conference presentations, FRBR would tell us how these items are related.   FRBR applied to the typical academic output Credit: replicated from another source by Hugh Paterson III    How do \u0026lsquo;Manuals of Style\u0026rsquo; requirements map to FRBR concepts? The case of translators, dealing with pre-prints and post-prints.

The issue is that so much of our information content is accessed through the web (http/https). This leads to a reasonable question like: Isn\u0026rsquo;t everything a Web page? To which the resounding answer should be \u0026ldquo;No\u0026rdquo;. Some things which are accessed through the web are not web pages. In the very early days academic books (e.g., Studying the History of English) and even journal articles ( D-Lib Magazine, First Monday, SIL Electronic Working Papers, etc.) were presented as series of web pages — often without database driven content management systems. These sorts of resources should be referenced as book or journal articles, not Web pages. In a similar manner Wikipedia articles should be referenced as encyclopedia articles, not Web pages. Blog posts and social media posts are also not Web pages even though they constitute a significant portion of the web. Part of the reason for these distinctions lies in the facts that Zotero and manuals of style have distinct item types for these other types of information units.\nZotero Screen for Web Pages   Zotero record for an archived webpage.

Credit: Hugh Paterson III    Adding CSL Types and Variables The typical use-case for the Extra field is to add additional CSL variables to a Zotero record. The syntax for adding content follows the pattern variable-name: value. In the above case DOI: 10.1234/abcd which is an example of adding the DOI field to a book, which does not by default have a DOI field.\nIn addition to adding CSL variables, the Zotero Item-type can be overridden using the same syntax pattern as variables, but using CSL Types. In this way a Zotero book section record could be interpreted as a dataset or collection. The syntax for this follows the pattern: Type: CSL-Type.\n  Zotero\u0026rsquo;s Extra Field can get larger if given more space — making writing in it easier.

Credit: Hugh Paterson III    Custom Types and Fields There is a fluke in the Zotero processor which allows custom (non CSL) values to be added to the Extra field and processed by the CSL processing software. This can only be taken advantage of if one also manages their own custom .csl XML file. For example, if I wanted a type of elephant I could put Type: elephant in the Extra field. This would be passed to the CSL process as type elephant. However, one would need to write a style sheet which assigned attributes to type elephant when references were processed into a document.\nThe most common use-case for a custom field I have encountered is for annotated bibliographies. Some CSL styles use a custom field in the Extra field to pass annotated bibliography information to the reference processing software. However, I have noticed custom fields inserted into the Extra filed from various online imports. Though I have yet to see these values passed on to references within style sheets.\nSome additional custom fields which would be nice to see wider spread adoption is alternatives to the DOI fields. For example Archival Resource Keys could be supported with a field like ark: xyz123 but this would require support by .csl file writers. ARKs are seeing wider adoption within the archival community and are likely to continue to increase in visibility.\n","date":1623715200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1536451200,"objectID":"5cea4a91dea8708a0cd00e433e135f13","permalink":"https://hughandbecky.us/Hugh-CV/books/zotero-examples/zotero-extra-field/","publishdate":"2021-06-15T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/Hugh-CV/books/zotero-examples/zotero-extra-field/","section":"books","summary":"Zotero\u0026rsquo;s Extra field is a special field and can be utilized effectively in several ways.

If the title does not include an acronym which is commonly used for the conference name, include the acronym in square brackets or parentheses following the conference name.

Smith, Sean, Jr.\nArgue against publishing a book seperately:\nUse “In” to designate chapters in collections. This makes the book’s format maximally similar to the standard citation format.

Thus: 22(1). 135-169. Note the space between volume number/issue and page numbers. Special formatting (e.g., bold for volume number) is superfluous. Issue numbers are a parenthetical modifier (cf. \u0026ldquo;ed.\u0026rdquo; above) of the volume number. While it is not NECESSARY information for identifying the article, it is extremely USEFUL information.  From the perspective of running a large collaborative group in a team that relies on Slack a lot, I'm somewhat skeptical. We have an \u0026quot;add to Zotero\u0026quot; channel that we have RAs periodically go through to add items to the Zotero library. WORK FLOW ADVICE!!! The reason for that is that a) metadata isn't always perfect and it's best to fix right on import and b) you'll want to file \u0026amp; tag items right away and by the time you've added collection support to Zotero in Slack you've established such a complex syntax that it's probably easier to just use Zotero. 'In this case, you can either go through your library and change all the names that refer to the same person to the exact same form, or you can simply use a style that doesn't disambiguate names.' I strongly recommend that you identify authors in your Zotero library with names that are entered with different levels of completeness. Edit those author names so that each name matches the entry with the most complete name (first middle and last names). Earlier editions of APA and Chicago style guides mandated (or strongly recommended) this. I'm unsure of the status of that recommendation in current versions. I am not aware of any style guide that prohibits this practice. For example, the Chicago Manual of Style states: “Authors’ names are normally given as they appear on the title pages of their books or above their articles. Certain adjustments, however, should be made to assist correct identification. First names may be given in full in place of initials. If an author uses his or her given name in one cited book and initials in another (e.g., “Mary L. Jones” versus “M. L. Jones” versus “Mary Jones” versus “Mary Lois Jones” versus “M. Jones”), the same form, preferably the fuller one, should be used in all references to that author. To assist alphabetization, middle initials or names should be given wherever known”.

I am specifically interested in user-contributed metadata platforms and quality control in those digital library contexts. I have long noticed the need for spell checking and for the ability to move folksonomy terms to controlled vocabulary terms at certain archives stewarding linguistic and language resources. I read the following three articles for UNT work:\n Hider, P., \u0026amp; Tan, K.-C. (2008). Constructing Record Quality Measures Based on Catalog Use. Cataloging \u0026amp; Classification Quarterly, 46(4), 338–361. https://doi.org/10.1080/01639370802322515 Kumar, V., Maurya, S., \u0026amp; Ji, G. (2022). An Assessment of Spelling and Typographical Errors in WebOPAC of Academic Libraries. Journal of Library Metadata, 22(1–2), 63–73. https://doi.org/10.1080/19386389.2022.2051978 Petrucciani, A. (2015). Quality of Library Catalogs and Value of (Good) Catalogs. Cataloging \u0026amp; Classification Quarterly, 53(3–4), 303–313. https://doi.org/10.1080/01639374.2014.1003669   Across these articles, I really appreciate the internationally diverse perspectives brought by these authors. Kumar et al. (2022) has some really clear methodologies (I feel like I could replicate the experiment in my location) and looks at spelling mistakes in a catalog where the language of instruction (at the institution) may be English, but the first language of many (maybe most) of the people there is not English. It seems natural that there would be spelling mistakes in these environments. In the archive that I worked at (in Dallas, Tx. no less) I offered to do a spell-check analysis on titles and folksonomy terms. The staff were less than ecstatic to receive any feedback on the records as that would mean that they would need to do more work to correct them. (In that situation the archive\u0026rsquo;s catalog has central staff supporting some collections and core infrastructure, and remote staff around the world supporting location specific collections.) Depending on which collection the misspelling was found in would determine which remote staff would need to approve the changes. So I appreciate the management at the instution where Kumar and collegues did their work to have a willingness to allow this kind of research. I hope that they then engaged with the results. In the case of the archive at which I worked, they also have a remote accession tool for digital objects. I\u0026rsquo;ve suggested they add a spell check system to that tool to catch errors in the accession process, but it has been argued that those features are not mission critical. This leads back to an analysis of what are the financial priorities of the management. If an archive has no specific materials re-use objective then this could have a direct impact on the quality of the records in interesting ways. For example, an archive without a specific requirement to engage the public in innovative ways (or at all) or where this process of engagement is disjunct from cataloging, curation, and preservation activities may not seek to maintain their records in a way where potential targest would benefit.\nSince I am interested in linguistics and language resource records and their quality I found the description of the types of errors in Italian libraries interesting. Petrucciani (2015), an article which was derived from a speech given at a conference, says the following of the Italian situation (p. 304 \u0026amp; 309):\n In Italy, for example, the main factors may be the widespread outsourcing of cataloging activities (especially retrospective conversion and cataloging of backlogs, bequests, etc.) with very low remuneration and lack of quality control, and the participation in library networks (mainly the national network SBN, Servizio Bibliotecario Nazionale) of small libraries—public, religious, or special—run by unqualified people or volunteers, without skilled staff. In many countries, an apparent factor is the lack of competence in foreign languages among cataloging staff, resulting in wrong language coding (e.g., Spanish for Italian or vice versa, Russian for books in any language written in Cyrillic script) and the abundance of misprinted words.\n  These (and many more) examples are not errors. Or better, they are not simply errors. They are the result of cataloging rules and policies, of the design of OPAC interfaces, or of bibliographic formats. The low quality of large catalogs is not simply due to the vast amount of duplicated records, unprofessional work, errors of interpretation, miskeyings, and so on, but in the first place to the misunderstanding (and undervaluing) of the functions and aims of bibliographic information and to unwise cataloging standards, rules, and policies.\n Again he attributes the errors to management practices established at institutions. In other parts of his paper Petrucciani points out that tools like Google Search and full text search options available exploit the problems that less-than-perfect catalogs have. That is, end-users for a variety of reasons turn to Google Search instead of catalog searches. I have long found interesting that Google doesn\u0026rsquo;t return results for books found in library catalogs. Its like library catalogs are part of the dark web.\nI found the approach by Hider and Tan (2008) inspiring. I often look at records found in the Open Language Archives Community (OLAC). One of the open questions there has been how to assess data providers and the quality of the data provided. OLAC records are often sourced from digital repositories where accessions are described by the creators/depositors. This means that variation in management practices at the data provider to OLAC impact the quality of record which OLAC has to aggregate. The current method (Hughes, 2005) is to count the DC elements on a record, average the count on each record and assign that average to the archive to rank the data providers. In this framework quality is only measured on the basis of the syntax present in the record rather than any sort of syntax-semantics relationship. e.g., Does a date element really contain valid date data? This method does not attempt to measure the validity or conformity of the data values to Dublin Core or OLAC recommendations. With regards to OLAC metadata quality, the current status quo follows the methods laid out by B. Hughes which is to count the DC elements on a record, average the count on each record and assign that average to the data provider and then to rank the data providers. In this framework Quality is only measured on the basis of the syntax (number of elements) present in the record rather than any sort of syntax-semantics relationship. E.g., does a date really appear in a date field and are they really valid dates? This method does not attempt to measure the validity or conformity of the data values to Dublin Core or OALC recommendations in terms of the semantics or the well-formedness of the values. In a sense the OLAC method of quality is similar to what MARC record generators call Encoding Level.\nIn contrast to B. Hughes\u0026rsquo; approach I have suggested that the DCMIType vocabulary in conjunction with the dc:format , dc:relation , dc:medium \u0026amp; tableOfContents elements could be used to provide continuity checks to the type of artifact being described. The purpose here would be to check for the completeness of a description if there is evidence in the record that specific type is present. This would would be a step towards enforcing the Dublin Core 1-to-1 principle. In a way the suggested process uses a fingerprinting process for each DCMIType. Common linguistic artifact types could be crafted (fingerprinted) and also added to the checks. These crafted fingerprints would appear in the documentation where recommendations existed for describing materials.\nA third method to look at quality is to look at the records that people are visiting and clicking through. People found these records and they must be interesting for some reason. An investigation of the most successful records in providing click-throughs to target websites is one way to assess the quality of a record. That is, is the record valuable to an audience? This third method of establishing quality is discussed in Hider \u0026amp; Tan (2008). They look at MARC records, but we have Dublin Core records, so some generalities and abstractions to their arguments may be needed before application.\nI find the idea of measuring record quality based on its use interesting. With nearly 450K records in OLAC but only some 8,000 views per month (Bird \u0026amp; Simons, 2021) a natural question arises. Which records are being viewed and are these the same ones month-over-month? Is there something \u0026ldquo;higher quality\u0026rdquo; about these records that they are being found and used? Recent work by Husic (2014) and Osborn (2019) show that adding Library of Congress Subject Headings (LCSH) to records does make them more visible to search engines. So maybe the highly used OLAC records have LCSH terms attached? This is something worth looking into and reporting on.\nReferences Bird, Steven, and Gary Simons. 2021. “Towards an Agenda for Open Language Archiving.” In Proceedings of the International Workshop on Digital Language Archives: LangArc 2021, edited by Oksana Zavalina and Shobhana Lakshmi Chelliah, 25–28.

For example, when dealing with Qualified Dublin Core, librarians suggest not using both dc:Description and dcterms:Abstract. That is, dcterms:Abstract ought to be reserved for semantically valid abstracts as understood in print media. However, What is to say that dcterms:Abstract can not be applied to any item qualified with any value of the DCMIType? That is, what is the abstract of a sound, software, event or physical object? This may seem absurd in some cases, but is a sound clip or a movie trailer not the same as an abstract?\n  Dublin Core has several design principles intended for its use. Two of them are the 1-to-1 Principle and the Repeatability principle. The question I wish to pose is how can these two principles interact in predictable ways? The Repeatability principle says that any described object can have multiple instances of the same element describing a resource. For example, two or three instances of dc:subject as part of an object record makes sense. The 1-to-1 Principle says that each record should only describe one object. The 1-to-1 Principle seems rather straight forward until one faces constraints imposed by technology platforms or seeks to describe aggregate works. Setting aside the issue of describing aggregate works, how do these principles interact when working with Qualified Dublin Core? That is, does the 1-to-1 Principle provide constraints to the application of the Repeatability Principle. For example, qualified dc:type elements with the DCMIType vocabulary ought to only be used in their singularity. Presumably, a record with both a qualified type of \u0026ldquo;text\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;sound\u0026rdquo; each relating to different files in a \u0026ldquo;record bundle\u0026rdquo; would be in violation of the 1-to-1 Principle. For a different crazy example consider: how can a qualified dc:type.dcmitype.sound also be dc:type.dcmitype.event? That is, not only are there limits to via the 1-to-1 Principle, but also internal term-specific semantics of the qualified terms are limiting, but it seems that there are repeatable types of interactions which specifically limit the application of the Repeatability principle. Perhaps no terms are more in semantically incompatible than \u0026ldquo;collection\u0026rdquo; and any other term in the DCMIType vocabulary. How can something be a \u0026ldquo;collection\u0026rdquo; and also a \u0026ldquo;text\u0026rdquo; unless we are arbitrarily assigning the type text to each item within the collection. However, doing this is a violation of the practice of description that indicates that the record should only apply to a single layer of the description — presumably the entire collection at this point, so DCMIType \u0026ldquo;Collection\u0026rdquo; should not co-occur with any other DCMIType qualifier. Note, I am only speaking of situations which qualify the type element from the dcterms namespace. Obviously, dc:type can be unqualified, and can also be qualified differently from different namespaces and all of these can co-exist.\n  Some thought has gone into a Dublin Core Constraint Language. See the linked propsal. However, this seems to be taking constraints in yet another direction.\n Since a dct:license value is only valid as long as copyright is also valid, and since copyright length varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, how is the jurisdiction of the copyright registration (claim/standing) indicated? For further discussion on this question see: https://github.com/dcmi/usage/issues/104\n  What qualifier on the \u0026ldquo;date\u0026rdquo; element is used on a record which also contains a dc:type element where the DCMIType qualified value is \u0026ldquo;Event\u0026rdquo;? It seems that date elements qualify a number of types of resources describable with the DCMIType vocabulary. However, specific dates inferring a relationship for Events are not explicitly clear. The general date element is available and the duration syntax could be used. But is this sufficient for the kinds of dates needed in regards to Event descriptions?\n  How is one to indicate the script a resource is in via Dublin Core? One could use the language tag with a valid BCP-47 tag but this is not mentioned in the usage guide. (One would need to indicate either RFC4646 or RFC5646 as the refinement of language.) If am I to correctly understand the situation, new approved syntaxes have crept into DC/DCT usage over time via the language tag recommendations as the IETF approves new language tag related RFCs.\n  To prevent this from happening maybe the DC Usage board can just define a syntax for BCP-47 which will remain a stable pointer without needing to invoke a specific RFC defined syntax. BCP-47 has in the past pointed to each of RFC1766, RFC3066, RFC4646, RFC5646. Each progressive standard in the BCP-47 series does not invalidate the next set of codes but rather adds specification. All RFC1766 tags are valid RFC5646 tags, but not all RFC5646 tags are valid RFC1766 tags. However all RFC1766 tags and all RFC1766 tags are valid BCP-47 tags. As I understand things, by pointing to RFC5646 rather than BCP-47 it does not allow for the implementation of RFC6067 and RFC6497 within the narrowly interpreted syntax of RFC5646. RFC5646 allows for 35 subtags with in the BCP-47 space, RFC6067 and RFC6497 define two of these without changing the syntax of the BCP-47 tag scheme. It\u0026rsquo;s just that when narrowly understood, RFC5646, now doesn\u0026rsquo;t include all of BCP-47.\nMy thought is that it might be possible to just define BCP-47 as a syntax and if additional sub-tags are registered then there is no-need on the part of DCMI to update the number of syntaxes DC/DCT count as valid.\nDublin Core does not specify a specific syntax. Therefore it must get its syntax from an application profile, a specific instanciation of defined community agreements. When the syntax is XML, the exact nature of the allowable elements and attributes may vary based on the namespaces declared in the header. Therefore I have a general question about the use of the xsi:type=\u0026quot;\u0026quot; attribute in XML, as the xsi namespaces is often declared in Dublin Core application profiles. Do values of xsi:type=\u0026quot;\u0026quot; need to be namespaced? The Open Language Archive application profiles (based on Dublin Core and OAI: therefore XML) uses namespaced values such as xsi:type=\u0026quot;olac:role\u0026quot;. So what happens if I just use role without namespacing it? I had this issue come up in some other dublin core project and I couldn\u0026rsquo;t get a clear answer. That project doesn\u0026rsquo;t namespace xsi:type=\u0026quot;\u0026quot; values and I suggested that those non-namespaced values shouldn\u0026rsquo;t validate\u0026hellip; but then project owners said: \u0026ldquo;oh the code validates just fine\u0026rdquo;\u0026hellip;. but I\u0026rsquo;m thinking that it syntactically validates as valid XML but does not validate against a schema. The second thing I was thinking was where does the xsi:type=\u0026quot;\u0026quot; validate against when there is no namespace? An OLAC (or any OAI based aggregator) security concern would be to close this gap and force all xsi:type=\u0026quot;\u0026quot; uses to namespace as a required practice. ELSE fail a required validation.  The book XML in a Nutshell says the following:\n xsi:type The xsi:type attribute may be used in instance documents to indicate the type of an element, even when a full schema is not available. For example, this length element has type xs:decimal : \u0026lt;length xsi:type=\u0026quot;xs:decimal\u0026quot;\u0026gt;23.5\u0026lt;/length\u0026gt; More importantly, the xsi:type attribute enables a limited form of polymorphism. That is, it allows you to make an element an instance of a derived type where an instance of the base type would normally be expected. The instance of the derived type must carry an xsi:type attribute identifying it as an instance of the derived type. For example, suppose a schema says that a ticket element has type TicketType . If the schema also defines BusTicketType and AirplaneTicketType elements as subtypes of TicketType , then a ticket element could also use the BusTicketType and AirplaneTicketType content models provided it had an xsi:type=\u0026quot;BusTicketType\u0026quot; or xsi:type=\u0026quot;AirplaneTicketType\u0026quot; attribute.\n But here again what if AirplaneTicketType is not defined in the base schema?\nThis sort of question seems to have been asked on stack exchange where it is pointed out that in the XML specification that all elements need to be defined. See also Type Definition and this stack exchange explination for the XML header.\n","date":1665581745,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1665581745,"objectID":"4b95b6b2665d757d67e01dea996f6c16","permalink":"https://hughandbecky.us/Hugh-CV/post/dublin-core-theory/","publishdate":"2022-10-12T14:35:45+01:00","relpermalink":"/Hugh-CV/post/dublin-core-theory/","section":"post","summary":"If we take a design look at Dublin Core, is it really as flexible as proclaimed or are there limits imposed by semantics.","tags":["Semantics","Metadata","Dublin Core","OLAC"],"title":"Some questions on the theory presented in the Dublin Core","type":"post"},{"authors":["Hugh Paterson III"],"categories":["Peer Reviewed","Conference"],"content":"   Bibliography   Lynch,\u0026#32; Gibson\u0026#32;\u0026amp;\u0026#32;Han (2020)  Lynch,\u0026#32; J.,\u0026#32; Gibson,\u0026#32; J.\u0026#32;\u0026amp;\u0026#32;Han,\u0026#32; M. \u0026#32; (2020). \u0026#32;Analyzing and Normalizing Type Metadata for a Large Aggregated Digital Library.

Behind every website is an idea, behind successful websites are ideas which have undergone testing and experimentation. The first step in creating a testable hypothesis is to document that proposal and then to set out to test it. Websites can embody business ideas and in some cases business tools like the business model canvas can give a \u0026ldquo;first stab\u0026rdquo; look at how different constituents might engage with different components of a website. Eventually, for a well tested website one would want to create user cards and define user pathways through the website as they accomplish user interaction goals on the website. This is generally accepted as good practice in user experience design. Once these pathways are documented and the user actions documented and enabled then testing with real users can commence.\nWhat follows here is my first stab at the types of users which are assumed to use the Open Language Archives Community aggregator website. My breakdown of users here will differ Bird and Simon\u0026rsquo;s 2022 article: The Open Language Archives Community: A 20-year update published in The Electronic Library.\nI present my diagrams using the Business Model Canvas tool, but I am only addressing the basic constituents which can also be found in the simpler Value Proposition Canvas. With regard to these basic constituents some of the points made in Bird and Simons 2022 article fit well with some of the \u0026ldquo;gains\u0026rdquo; type statements expected on that canvas. I\u0026rsquo;m not interested in those statements at this time, but they are important. Rather I want to sus-out how many different classes of constituents there actually are engaging with the website.\nMy inital guess is that there are at least five clear constituenties which are interested in interactions on the OLAC website. I outline these as follows:\n End-User Browser People These are real people who come to the site looking to access resources from data providers. Submitter Technologists People These are real people who come to the site to work with the tools to check their data feeds and submit data to the website. Data Researchers These are real people who come to the site to research the status of resource availability. They are not looking to acquire resources, only to answer questions regarding the nature of the existance of things. Data Harvesters These are machines which pull from select data points advertised. One example of this is how Worldcat (OCLC) harvests from OLAC via OAI. Search Engines — SEO These are machines which are programmed to crawl the webpages of OLAC\u0026rsquo;s web interface and index it for some purpose — generally for aggregation in another search interface. An example of this might be Google via the googlebot.    The five classes of constituents Credit: Hugh Paterson III     If we were to draw users pathways for this web experience we would want to identify each of the tasks of each person and then map that to feature and URLs. In this post I am only going to be looking at data types. That is, the kinds of data that each of the constituents desires to interact with or obtain.\n Currently End-user engage with a web-interface which is written in HTML 3.2. Submitter technologists also engage with HTML 3.2 based forms. Data researchers can engage with and download the XML original, the XML OLAC version, they can also download some RDF style version of the data. These \u0026ldquo;data dumps\u0026rdquo; then also support programatic access. Unique for programatic access is the OAI interface. Search engines currently must use HTTP and encounter HTML 3.2.    Data Expressions in indicated as channels in the BMC Credit: Hugh Paterson III     In the next image I write down some of the positive reasons that people come to the website. That is, the value they come to the site to recieve.

Billey encourages a thoughtful response of caution and abstinence from the onslaught of the RDA practice, while Serra and colleagues discuss the technical details of how personal identifiers are entered into MARC records.s\nInstitutional Morals The work of Amber Billey is especially thought provoking at several levels because of the various kinds of assumptions that it makes and how it situates its arguments in the socio-political context. For example, at one level it argues from the ethics statement of the American Libraries Association. The author makes reference to statements number 1 and number 7:\n  We provide the highest level of service to all library users through appropriate and usefully organized resources; equitable service policies; equitable access; and accurate, unbiased, and courteous responses to all requests.    We distinguish between our personal convictions and professional duties and do not allow our personal beliefs to interfere with fair representation of the aims of our institutions or the provision of access to their information resources.   I particularly am interested in statement seven because, in this case institutions become the moral conviction holders rather than individuals. Institutions within the American legal context are designed to be the legal liability absorbers and as such are able agents of action shielding individuals from legal liability, socio-political blow-back, and negotiating interpersonal relationships at the moral level. The sociology of institutions change and to the degree that institutions have an open member-driven articulation of their moral convictions, the representation of institutional morals appears to represent the collective of institutional staff. However, homogeneity should never be assumed. The fact remains, catalogers hired by organizations are workers-for-hire and are not given the liberty to express (all) their opinions on (all) topics. In capitalistic societies such as the United States, it is legally required that these institutions (both for-profit and non-profit) make decisions which sustain the organization. This may at times come at the cost of individuals within the organization, but talk to HR—talent is replaceable. So as I read this article the framing of the argument is that organizations such as the Library of Congress and IFLA members have determined that for the benefit of their future sustainability that the identification of personally identifying information within the Name Authority Records is important. To limit their liability and blow-back they conveniently allow the American Library Association (ALA) to steward Resource Description and Access (RDA), and then the ALA tells information professionals that they should not interfere with these policies or practices.\nContent in the Name Authority Record The attributes under consideration and provided for by the Resource Description and Access guidelines include the following:\n Name of the Person Dates Associated with the Person Title of the Person Fuller Form of Name Other Designation Associated with the Person Gender Place of Birth Place of Death Country Associated with the Person Place of Residence, Etc. Address of Person Affiliation Language of Person Field of Activity of the Person  To me, as a privacy policy and privacy law researcher, I see some definite overlaps with Personally Identifying Information in a variety of Legal Frameworks ( GDPR, CCPA, etc.)\nWhile I am interested in wider applications of RDA and Name Authority Files, my thoughts immediately pull me in the direction of so-called \u0026ldquo;language archives\u0026rdquo; or institutions which steward language resources. There are ample examples where personally identifying information is kept out of the record within the domains of anthropological linguistics, language documentation, along with records produced for resource preservation and stewardship supporting these areas of praxis (including language development—language revitalization). There is some degree of overlap in the reasons for not identifying these attributes of named entities in stewarded resources with those articulated by Billey, but there are others as well.\nFrom a personal perspective I don\u0026rsquo;t see how the following are necessary for library purposes:\n Gender Place of birth Place of death Country associated with the person Place of residence Address of person Language of person Field of activity  For example, the language of a person may change over time, and who is to define (limit) a person\u0026rsquo;s field of activity by the use of discrete categories? My initial reaction is that to add these things to the library record in a definitive way is over-reach and invasive. This is not the same as adding these details to a collection description within a the context of an archival collection or a corpus where-about the contributors are described. The contrast is this: in a Name Authority Record, the fields are permanent and describe the entity (person) across the entire range of their existence, where as in an archival collection or a corpus, they describe the person at the point (or range) of the collection\u0026rsquo;s creation. Name Authority Records are unbounded with regards to the number of resources they are applied to, where as within the context of a collection description or a corpus description there is a scoping of the number of resources to-which the description applies.\nWithin the context of language science research many have vocalized the need to be able to search across collection descriptions and corpus descriptions which include things like language used in a resource, or people of a place, or an age range of a broader population (for examples of dynamics of corpora sorting see some of the topics discussed in my 2012 post Metadata Dynamics for Linguistic and Sociolinguistic Corpora). That is, re-users of language resources do want these types of constructs available to them to search by, even if coverage is inconsistent or low. However, attaching these attributes to a person rather than a resources is un-discussed by Billey in this article.\nRecords, User Interfaces, and Linked Data While libraries continue to build the traditional authority file, there are other external identity management sources of linked data that could be used instead, thereby fulfilling the promise of linked data. Both Billey and Serra et al., discusses this but from different perspectives. Billey discusses the distribution of and social proliferation of authority data as linked data, while Serra and colleges discuss the technical implementation in and impact on MARC records.\nBilley writes in favor of including less information in Name Authority Records supporting her argument with the following statement (page 11):\n With linked data, this information travels far beyond the servers at OCLC and the Library of Congress. Regardless of data in the authority records, we still do not have a catalog or discovery layer that facilitates a search or browse experience that utilizes the RDA elements being recorded about persons. \u0026hellip; Only a fraction of authority records contain the new elements, so the query results would not be accurate or reliable enough to be helpful to users.\n Rather than arguing against inclusion of new RDA supported MARC fields it seems that this argues for an abstraction layer to resource discovery which only uses part of the record in deciding relevance for IFLA recognized end-user discovery and exploring tasks. In this context privacy is not really an issue because other data providers in the linked data \u0026ldquo;cloud\u0026rdquo; can provide additional facets by which information can be sorted. I find that the argument for not providing data in a record due to the lack of a User Interface support for the data field, to be circular, as User Interface development often looks at which data is present to determine User Interface development goals. Additionally, Both Billey and Serra et. al seem to assume that URIs related to a person (such as ORCID, VIAF, or ISNI identifiers) are stable. They seem to easily forget that even PURLs have had interruptions to resolving and DOIs suffer from link rot (Citation: Habibzadeh,\u0026#32; 2013) Habibzadeh,\u0026#32; P. \u0026#32; (2013). \u0026#32;Decay of References to Web sites in Articles Published in General Medical Journals: Mainstream vs Small Journals.

Not that I think the author\u0026rsquo;s assertions are invalid, but rather they are not well supported. The author asks catalogers and policy makers to think about the following by quoting questions from (Citation: Thompson,\u0026#32; 2016) Thompson,\u0026#32; K. \u0026#32; (2016). \u0026#32;More Than a Name: A Content Analysis of Name Authority Records for Authors Who Self-Identify as Trans. Library Resources \u0026amp; Technical Services,\u0026#32;60(3).\u0026#32;140–155. https://doi.org/10.5860/lrts.60n3.140  :\n Is there potential for this information to harm the [person] through outing or violating the right to privacy?\n Yet the author has yet to identify any legal rights framework under-which this question may be answered. Within the United States privacy is not a universal right acknowledged and granted by a government, but rather a transactionally regulated issue in consumer law. Only some organizations and some types of transactions at certain volumes qualify. With the European Union the right to privacy is inalienable, but there is no private right of action to \u0026ldquo;sue\u0026rdquo; violators, hence consequences and liability of violations are limited by the capacity of the prosecutors who would have legal authority to bring action. For libraries or organizations to assume that individuals have these rights is errant. Organization may see it as beneficial to their ongoing relationships with their constituencies with respect and codify that respect in policy, but they are not rights. However, with regard to the RDA based fields, an interesting question arises as to if the death of a person affects what ought to be included in the Name Authority Record.\nThe author further goes on quoting Thompson asking:\n Is there an indication that the [person] consents to having this information shared publicly?\n The problem here is one of the use of positive evidence. Positive evidence does not mean that it is in the best interest of society at large. For example, if Google had waited to scan books rather than seeking out fair-use options in new social contexts we might not have the rich set of resources we know as HaithiTrust. Waiting for positive evidence is the best way to argue for inaction. In action may not be the best way to provide privacy in a linked data world as holes in the network of data can be just as revealing or even more so than actual data.\nBibliography   Billey (2019)  Billey,\u0026#32; A. \u0026#32; (2019). \u0026#32;Just Because We Can, Doesn’t Mean We Should: An Argument for Simplicity and Data Privacy With Name Authority Work in the Linked Data Environment.

They state:\n of the 62 registered archives, 27 have not been updated in the past five years, and an overlapping 19 archives are failing to harvest.\n Having been an long-time OLAC observer, I can attest that OLAC data providers both come and go, and some refresh their feeds. For example, the SIL Language \u0026amp; Culture Archive did not have an active OLAC feed between 2013 and 2021. But this has been fixed in 2022.\n  Another way to look at the issues which beset the network of OLAC data providers is to look at the network of technologies responsible for the data feed. To do this is challenging. Exact roles are not specified in the OLAC documentation. These roles appear in the OAI header for each data provider and the aggregation of these can be found in two places on the the OLAC website here (along with the detail pages) and here.\nWhen we look at the set of the data providers and we see the extent of providers which do not maintain their OLAC feeds we could interpret that as the death of nodes or part of the network. This might be better understood with a network diagram. So I made one.\n  While conducting this analysis it became apparent that there were several clades of providers which developed. By clade I mean a group of data providers which evolved together sharing an exposure to OLAC metadata and a technologist. Those clades are indicated in this image. The indicated clades are to be treated as suspect, but I think there is reason to believe that there is a great amount of sociological influence which permits these clades to form. For example, I know that at one time Gary Simons assisted AILLIA with their OLAC feed, so perhaps that archive might belong in a common clade with the entities within the SIL clade. If that is the case then maybe the SIL clade ought to be renamed as the Gary Simons clade. I also suspect there might be a CLARIN clade, but I don\u0026rsquo;t know for sure or how these relationships are or were structured. I also suspect that there might be or was an Australian clade in which Nick Thieberger would have been influential. If this is the case then the Hawaii clade may be suspect and rather than two clades (Hawaii and Australia) there may only be one which would include those entities assisted or guided by Professor Thieberger.\nThe image is incomplete with regard to the total number of data providers. It lacks the following data providers which were left out for visual space constraint reasons (and no other reason):\n Language resources at the Text Laboratory IULA UPF OAI Archive ODIN - The Online Database of Interlinear Text Cornell Language Acquisition Lab Living Archive of Aboriginal Languages Lund University Humanities Lab corpusserver Magoria Books\u0026rsquo; Carib and Romani Archive Multimodal Learning and teaching Corpora Exchange Perseus digital library The LINGUIST List Language Resources  It is my hope that a better understanding of where in the network and why network death occurs will contribute to a healthier social practice and healthier network.\n","date":1662730545,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1662730545,"objectID":"96ea7951d9b84671d1d2629a03e89c04","permalink":"https://hughandbecky.us/Hugh-CV/post/olac-social-network/","publishdate":"2022-09-09T14:35:45+01:00","relpermalink":"/Hugh-CV/post/olac-social-network/","section":"post","summary":"What is the best way to assess the health of the Open Language Archives Community network?","tags":["OLAC","Developers","Social Network","Data Providers"],"title":"OLAC Social Network","type":"post"},{"authors":["Hugh Paterson III"],"categories":["Jot"],"content":"The IFLA-LRM model does not currently have an overt relationship for linking two works together which is characterized by or labled: references/isReferencedBy.

For a long time the assumption has been that OLAC records are flat on the basis of Dublin Core constraints. This is not completely true with the presence of the DCMIType value Collection and the relationship hasPart or isPartOf. That is through these mechanisms a hierarchy can be infered.\nIn a while brain storming for other options Steven mentioned the OAI value for sets (and also the historical documentation in OAI version 1.0), which is an interesting part of the OAI protocol. Basically it is a way to establish classes that the OAI verbs will respect. How these classes are set up is completely dependent on the data source manager. So, unless an OLAC recomendation document established a set of classes which it expected OLAC data providers to implement I don\u0026rsquo;t see how this actually resolves or lowers complexity related to setting up an OAI service for OLAC to harvest from. However, classes can be useful if an OAI provider has several different clients it is seeking to facilitate but only wants to provide a single OAI endpoint.\nOpenEditions, the publisher in France, has an example of documentation where the OAI provider defines the sets they make available. They chose books, journals, blogs, and events as their sets. In some ways this could be navigated with DCMITypes and complex queries, but maybe some of thier clients OAI harvesters are only interested in certain sets (for example DOAJ is only interested in the journals). In the OLAC case, the harvester generally wants everything. So these specific classes doesn\u0026rsquo;t make much sense. I don\u0026rsquo;t redily see how OAI classes fit the proposed use case of establishing hierarchical structures for the description of collections. But perhaps another useful application can be thought of. The one case I can think of is if an OLAC data provider indexes resources which it doesn\u0026rsquo;t actually have a copy of and also indexes items it does have a copy of then these might be of interest to divide into two sets, but OLAC would harvest them both anyway.\n","date":1660743345,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1660743345,"objectID":"0f04d07ad6208b7992ea14e53edf694d","permalink":"https://hughandbecky.us/Hugh-CV/post/oai-sets-for-olac/","publishdate":"2022-08-17T14:35:45+01:00","relpermalink":"/Hugh-CV/post/oai-sets-for-olac/","section":"post","summary":"Can OAI-Sets be employed to leverage collection information?","tags":["OLAC","OAI","Sets","Collections"],"title":"OAI-Sets for OLAC","type":"post"},{"authors":["Hugh Paterson III"],"categories":["Jot","Research Note"],"content":"I am doing some more research on the OLAC data contributors.

Credit: OLAC website via Hugh Paterson III     When using the OLAC faceted search and when I click a link for records in the Pacific Collection at the University of Hawai\u0026rsquo;i at Mānoa Hamilton Library, as seen on the page in link, I get an error message, as seen in the figure below, saying that it is interpreting a character incorrectly (decimal 129, which appears in the file output-library.xsl; Line#: 96; Column#: -1). 1\n  JAVA error Credit: OLAC website via Hugh Paterson III     I am wondering if this is because the input is encoded in Latin Supplement 1(ISO-8859-1 (Latin-1)), rather than Unicode UTF-8, or if it is because of some error on the OLAC processing side. It seems unlikely that a library system would be using decimal 129, which is a control character. I wonder if it left over from a MARC import?\nTo avoid this problem, it seems that at ingest the OLAC aggregator could use XSLT and map all illegal characters in HTML 4 to a space character. This might solve the problem on the OLAC side for all data feeds as discussed and demonstrated in link [3]. However, I\u0026rsquo;m still not sure if the data is parsed correctly as in, if the data feed is assumed to be UTF-8 by OLAC but is actually in another encoding format then maybe the parser is assuming that some bits go together to form a character which actually don\u0026rsquo;t.\nAfter consultation with technicians at the University of Hawai\u0026rsquo;i, they pointed out that this is likely an error the OLAC server side because this happens whenever there is a diacritic in the record. That is, search results involving diacritics often throw various errors or return no results.\n Archive: The Crúbadán Project  Archive: LINDAT/CLARIAH-CZ digital library at the Institute of Formal and Applied Linguistics (ÚFAL), Faculty of Mathematics and Physics, Charles University Subject: !Xóõ Subject: Abé  As a test, one can toss in àáâãäåæ into the search bar on this page. http://dla.library.upenn.edu/dla/olac/search.html?q= Hit search and they get misinterpreted as Ã Ã¡Ã¢Ã£Ã¤Ã¥Ã¦ This means that the search interface can not understand UTF-8 encoded text which ought to be the default. If one tries tossing in the upper case of versions ÀÁÂÃÄÅÆ into the search bar, you get an error because they get misinterpreted into the illegal range of HTML characters.\nTechnical staff at the University of Hawai\u0026rsquo;i also pointed out that when testing Unicode characters via a charset converter that the same results appear. For example if one enters the characters àáâãäåæ in the converter and selects convert Latin to UTF-8 and you\u0026rsquo;ll get the same misinterpreted results as before Ã Ã¡Ã¢Ã£Ã¤Ã¥Ã¦. The situation with upper-case charcters is slightly different. If one tries the upper case letters it just returns back Ã€Ã Ã‚ÃƒÃ„Ã…Ã† which is clearly wrong since all the letters can\u0026rsquo;t map to Ã.

The modern area of academic practice known as language documentation has its roots in anthropological linguistics but maintains a strong adherence to ideals which call for the archiving of source materials. The purpose for archiving is to benefit the many stakeholders involved in language development activities. Language archives, hosting language resources, have by and large adopted Dublin Core as a metadata standard along with the additional metadata terms of the Open Language Archive Community (OLAC) application profile as described in Bird and Simons (2001, 2003). This study is a first look at how the DCMIType 'Collection' is used across aggregated records from language archives. This study finds that current practices of arrangement and description at language resource preservation institutions participating in OLAC do not currently follow archival best practices in arrangement and description as described in frameworks like Describing Archives: A Content Standard including honoring principles like respect des fonds. This has multiple impacts including consequences in web-based navigation and discoverability.","tags":["Archive","OLAC","Metadata","DCMIType","Collection"],"title":"Where Have All the Collections Gone?: Analysis of OLAC Data Contributors' use of DCMIType 'Collection'","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Hugh Paterson III","H.

In linguistics, framing is the establishment of a context under which a narrative is experienced. Lakoff and Filmore are both researchers in the concepts around framing.\nThe Open Language Archives Community (OLAC) metadata profile is built on Dublin Core and OAI. Essentially OLAC OAI feeds (to the OLAC aggregator) are modified (or \u0026ldquo;enhanced\u0026rdquo; using the XML attribute xsi:type=\u0026quot; \u0026quot;) OAI-PMH feeds. The OAI protocol was originally developed to be used by repository software to communicate with other repositories—in an effort to make a network of repositories. The OAI protocol works well as designed. The OLAC implementation of OAI inherits some of the OAI provided terms and concepts. When OLAC was first created, the profile was originally assumed to be describing archived language resources, and archives were assumed to be repositories—at least in the OAI sense. Many, including recent publications talk about \u0026ldquo;archives\u0026rdquo; providing records to the OLAC aggregator. These claims and references are interesting, confusing, and inaccurate—though if the sense of archive, is really and OAI repository, then I seen the connection. However, that is not what most people think of when they hear language archive or archive.\nThe framing of terms from the OAI context is laid out in the introduction to the OAI-PMH standard. The following definitions are given.\n Data Providers administer systems that support the OAI-PMH as a means of exposing metadata; and Service Providers use metadata harvested via the OAI-PMH as a basis for building value-added services. A repository is a network accessible server that can process the 6 OAI-PMH requests in the manner described in this document. A repository is managed by a data provider to expose metadata to harvesters. To allow various repository configurations, the OAI-PMH distinguishes between three distinct entities related to the metadata made accessible by the OAI-PMH.  The distinction here is that the corporate entity implementing data sharing technology is the Data Provider. While the server technology implementing the access is call the repository.\nHowever, within the OLAC documentation and academic literature presenting OLAC further conceptualization of terms occurs.\nThe use of the term \u0026ldquo;archive\u0026rdquo; to mean all data providers to OLAC is interesting from a linguistic point of view because by calling Data Providers (in the OAI sense) \u0026ldquo;archives\u0026rdquo; authors use the language of inclusion which maps well to the concepts of \u0026ldquo;open\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;community\u0026rdquo; which can be found in the OLAC name, but the language of inclusion here does not acknowledge the diversity of the kinds of data providers. While inclusion and an under representation of diversity are the impacts, there may be other factors as well. If we look at the OLAC documentation, the documentation in the examples and in the XML elements calls things \u0026ldquo;archives\u0026rdquo;. Consider the OLAC Protocol which is an extension of the basic OAI-PMH protocol. Specifically, in section 3 where OLAC data providers are required to return a specific element when the OAI-PMH verb Identify is used. The title of the XML element is olac-archive. It has two possible attribute values personal or institutional. The example given is as follows:\n\u0026lt;olac-archive xmlns=\u0026quot;http://www.language-archives.org/OLAC/1.0/\u0026quot; xmlns:xsi=\u0026quot;http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\u0026quot; xsi:schemaLocation=\u0026quot;http://www.language-archives.org/OLAC/1.0/ http://www.language-archives.org/OLAC/1.0/olac-archive.xsd\u0026quot; type=\u0026quot;institutional\u0026quot;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;archiveURL\u0026gt;http://www.ethnologue.com\u0026lt;/archiveURL\u0026gt; \u0026lt;curator\u0026gt;Raymond G.

Camp Wisdom Rd., Dallas, TX 75236, U.S.A.\u0026lt;/location\u0026gt; \u0026lt;synopsis\u0026gt;The Ethnologue data provider gives a metadata record for every language entry in the Web edition of the Ethnologue. The latter provides basic information about each of the 7,000+ modern language of the world (both living and recently extinct).\u0026lt;/synopsis\u0026gt; \u0026lt;access\u0026gt;Every resource described by the Ethnologue data provider is a public Web page that may be accessed without restriction. Reuse of material on the site is subject to the Terms of Use that are posted.\u0026lt;/access\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/olac-archive\u0026gt;  As we see in the above example, the olac-archive or OAI repository is the Ethnologue. It is typed as an institutional OLAC archive. However, is the Ethnologue actually a language archive? What language resource can you go to the archive and get? It seems to me to be more like a typological database about socio-linguistic topics. While it might be too late now to do anything about it, the OLAC schema could have used the XML element olac-provider as a more neutral term.\nThe use of the term \u0026ldquo;archive\u0026rdquo; to mean all data providers to OLAC is confusing because the language of academic discourse around language archives and OLAC data providers is not discrete. That is, the language does not provide distinct categories where categories would be helpful. The OLAC protocol distinguishes between organizations and personal data providers, but OLAC doesn\u0026rsquo;t make any further distinction. Research which uses OLAC records as a dataset should take the diversity of data providers into account as analyses present observations and claims—especially about the description of artifacts, or percentages of Dublin Core Element use.\nFinally the claims that all data providers are \u0026ldquo;archives\u0026rdquo; is inaccurate—or careless at best. In my assessment I find that there is a mix of provider types which does not neatly fit into the personal / institutional dichotomy. In part that is because the personal / institutional dichotomy describes the OAI Data provider, not the OAI repository. As I evaluate the diversity of OAI repositories I find the dimension of personal / institutional less useful than one which included the terms: Archive, Repository, Museum, Gallery, Library, Special Collection, Personal Portfolio, Lab or Department Portfolio, Project Portfolio, Typological Database, and Bibliography. Roughly these fall into the broad categories of access institutions, exhibits, and reference resources. The following diagram puts these terms on a gradient of a data provider which is highly likely to have an advertised resource and be able to provide access to that resource to a provider which is likely not able to provide access to an advertised resource. It is this second dimension which is likely to impact the nature of OLAC records more than the first dimension of personal / institutional. The second dimension should be considered when using OLAC records as an object of study. If OLAC were to revise its protocol, these other terms should be considered to provide a better context for evaluating the quality and completeness of the records.\n  Types of OLAC Data Providers.

Many of these remarks are by linguists rather than persons from the tradition of information science. Therefore, it is hard to know how to evaluate these comments. For example, as a system the OLAC aggregator serves linguists as a user-group. So, should these remarks be classified as user-feedback, or should these comments be understood in the context of professional critique from information science professionals.\nAdditionally, there is the matter of perspective bias. By perspective bias I mean the difference between looking at OLAC\u0026rsquo;s metadata independently from the breadth of Dublin Core, versus looking at the breadth of Dublin Core and looking at how OLAC provides additional augmentation to the power of Dublin Core. In a way this is the difference between a Bottom-Up perspective, and a Top-Down perspective. Contrasting examples of this include (Citation: Austin,\u0026#32; 2013) Austin,\u0026#32; P. \u0026#32; (2013). \u0026#32;Language documentation and meta-documentation.\u0026#32;In\u0026#32;Jones,\u0026#32; M.\u0026#32;\u0026amp;\u0026#32;Ogilvie,\u0026#32; S.

However, these layers in the technology protocol are generally ignored by critics who see only the specific elements of the additions to Dublin Core.\n  I have collected several critiques of OLAC and present them below. I then discuss the perspective bias and why I think these critiques are understandable, but not well grounded.\nIn 2013 Peter Austin wrote:\n Since its establishment in the late 1990s language documentation has been dominated by declarative deductive approaches to recommendations for creating metadata which have been primarily influenced by library concepts (e.g. Dublin Core). Key metadata notions have been interoperability, standardization, discovery, and access (OLAC, 4 E-MELD, Good 2002, Farrar \u0026amp; Lewis 2007). However, the wider goals of language documentation (including the wider social goals relating to speaker community involvement) mean this is not powerful enough and we need, \u0026hellip;\n In his work, Austin incompletely presents the metadata available via OLAC through Dublin Core.\nThe sentiment that OLAC\u0026rsquo;s descriptive power is less than what language resource users desire is also mentioned by several authors working at CLARIN, TLA, or MPI including (Citation: Van Uytvanck et al.,\u0026#32; 2012) Van Uytvanck,\u0026#32; D.,\u0026#32; Stehouwer,\u0026#32; H.\u0026#32;\u0026amp;\u0026#32;Lampen,\u0026#32; L. \u0026#32; (2012). \u0026#32;Semantic metadata mapping in practice: The Virtual Language Observatory. \u0026#32; European Language Resources Association (ELRA).\u0026#32;Retrieved from\u0026#32; http://www.lrec-conf.org/proceedings/lrec2012/pdf/437_Paper.pdf  where they say:\n Traditionally the format used for metadata is OLAC, an extension of the ubiquitous Dublin Core schema, targeted towards the linguistic community. Although useful, OLAC lacks a deep semantic definition and relies mostly on best practice guidelines.\n Van Uytvanck et al. are correct in that several of the Dublin Core fields such as description are left open for interpretation by the data provider. This is normal for Dublin Core use-cases because the communication protocol is used for bringing together diverse information sources from multiple independent institutions where practices may diverge significantly. However, they miss that several of the modifier terms within the OLAC vocabularies are defined as being equivalent to linked data items such as Library of Congress Subject Heading terms. By looking for deep semantics from OLAC\u0026rsquo;s fields it ignores the purpose of its Dublin Core foundation — high level compatibility. Deep congruent semantics in the records found in OLAC will only come as OLAC data providers agree to a common practice of institutional curation and description of their holdings.\nAt the same conference (Citation: Broeder et al.,\u0026#32; 2012) Broeder,\u0026#32; D.,\u0026#32; Windhouwer,\u0026#32; M.,\u0026#32; Uytvanck,\u0026#32; D.,\u0026#32; Trippel,\u0026#32; T.\u0026#32;\u0026amp;\u0026#32;Goosen,\u0026#32; T. \u0026#32; (2012). \u0026#32;CMDI: a Component Metadata Infrastructure. \u0026#32; European Language Resources Association (ELRA).\u0026#32;Retrieved from\u0026#32; http://www.lrec-conf.org/proceedings/lrec2012/index.html  say the following:\n Since 2000 we have seen the rise of new LR [Language Resource] metadata schema as IMDI, IMDI [2003], IMDI [2009] and OLAC but application and uptake of these schema has been limited. Although OLAC is now used more or less as a standard for information exchange between LR archives, it is still delivering low specificity.\n Again low specificity seems to be leveraged at OLAC\u0026rsquo;s vocabularies without taking into account that specify can be enhanced through a variety of mechanisms including the use of Library of Congress Subject Heading terms and other Dublin Core linked vocabularies.\nThen (Citation: McCrae et al.,\u0026#32; 2015) McCrae,\u0026#32; J.,\u0026#32; Labropoulou,\u0026#32; P.,\u0026#32; Gracia,\u0026#32; J.,\u0026#32; Villegas,\u0026#32; M.,\u0026#32; Rodríguez-Doncel,\u0026#32; V.\u0026#32;\u0026amp;\u0026#32;Cimiano,\u0026#32; P. \u0026#32; (2015). \u0026#32;One Ontology to Bind Them All: The META-SHARE OWL Ontology for the Interoperability of Linguistic Datasets on the Web. \u0026#32; Springer International Publishing. https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-25639-9_42  say:\n This lack of consensus resides also in the description of LRs, even for non-linguistic concepts. In fact, there are as many metadata schema for their descriptions as catalogs and repositories for their presentation (e.g. those used by ELRA and the LDC) and communities describing them (e.g. TEI [14] or CES [13]). The most widely used schema for the exchange of LRs is the one suggested by the Open Language Archives Community [1, OLAC], which builds on the Dublin Core metadata and has been criticized as being too reductionistic. Differences between the schema lie in the range of features used and their labels and datatypes.\n While McCrae et al. summarize the literature, they also do not realize that the general perspective in the literature is top-down; first looking at the OLAC vocabularies and then (mostly missing) other kinds of modifying capabilities that Dublin Core and OAI provide to the OLAC application profile.\nIt is my opinion that important research can be conducted to look for relevant concepts to linguistics and language documentation in the various linked vocabularies natively occurring in Dublin Core.\nBibliography   Simons\u0026#32;\u0026amp;\u0026#32;Bird (2003)  Simons,\u0026#32; G.\u0026#32;\u0026amp;\u0026#32;Bird,\u0026#32; S. \u0026#32; (2003). \u0026#32;Building an Open Language Archives Community on the OAI foundation.

The case was made that Child Sponsorship Organizations solicit funds to the organization while presenting the faces of children to donors. The implicit connection between visual media and donor is that children are directly supported. However, it has been shown via investigative reporting that children often do not know they are sponsored or that organizations support community development rather than specific children. It is interesting that the instructional design takes this approach to the issue.\nSometimes the loudest things are not the things directly seen or discussed. The use case was presented in a way which allowed the audience of students to form a bias about the ethics of what the organizations are doing\u0026hellip; it appears that they are advertising that for a tax deduction someone can support a specific child. However, this is not legally possible in the USA. Consider the text of IRS Ruling 1962-113:\n If contributions to the fund are earmarked by the donor for a particular individual, they are treated, in effect, as being gifts to the designated individual and are not deductible. However, a deduction will be allowable where it is established that a gift is intended by a donor for the use of the organization and not as a gift to an individual.\n So under-discussed around this use-case are the legal ramifications to the organizations and their risk of endangering their donors with tax-fraud on the basis of their actions. Specifically in-class. That is, the IRS ruling was not mentioned in class at all.\nA second under-discussed point (both in class and more broadly) is how these organizations are treating personally identifiable information in the people they are \u0026ldquo;sponsoring\u0026rdquo; California, Colorado, and Virgina all have personal data protection laws which cover businesses operating there and residents in those states. There should be some impact on how personally identifying information (data) is shared or not. Personal data protection schemes are becoming more frequent around the world. NGOs need to be aware of how they are collecting and distributing names, birth-dates, and photos, etc.\nCourse Readings Scott, Esther (2002).

Participating archives each provide Dublin Core metadata via an OAI feed.Based on the needs of both linguists and language community members, Wasson et al. (2016) note that usability requirements are not met by language-archive records. Burke and Zavalina (2019, 2020) established that record composition for the free-text description field is used in various ways across the three archives they evaluated. Some of these free-text description fields indicated that the “item” was in fact more like a “collection”. However, collection records should have a different composition from individual artifact records because they each have distinct scopes. With this in mind, different record types should have distinct evaluation criteria. Unexplored in the literature are how record providers are utilizing distinct collection records.The current study explores the nature of linguistic and anthropological language-focused collection records in contrast to artifact records by investigating the use of the DCMIType attribute “collection”. Across the OLAC records, 850 use the DCMIType “collection” and only 7 providers even use the “collection” DCMIType. By using the DCMIType “collection” and relating artifact records with collection records via the Dublin Core “hasPart'' property, more about the original context of the collection is transferred from the host institution to the OLAC aggregator. When properly displayed this can lead to increased utility in browsing environments.","tags":["Archive","OLAC","Metadata","DCMIType","Collection"],"title":"Where Have All the Collections Gone?","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Hugh Paterson III","William Hall","Rebecca Paterson"],"categories":["Peer Reviewed","Conference"],"content":"   Abstract Bibliography   Chanard (2019)  Chanard,\u0026#32; C.\u0026#32; (2019). \u0026#32;ELAN-CorpA. \u0026#32; CNRS-LLACAN.\u0026#32;Retrieved from\u0026#32; http://llacan.vjf.cnrs.fr/res_ELAN-CorpA.php    Chanard (2015)  Chanard,\u0026#32; C. \u0026#32; (2015). \u0026#32;ELAN-CorpA: Lexicon-aided annotation in ELAN.\u0026#32;In\u0026#32;Mettouchi,\u0026#32; A.,\u0026#32; Vanhove,\u0026#32; M.\u0026#32;\u0026amp;\u0026#32;Caubet,\u0026#32; D.

Collister"],"categories":["Journal","Publication","Archive","Scholarly Publication"],"content":"Call for Papers Description In reaction to the rapid decline in linguistic diversity around the world, there has been a broad call for the increased allocation of resources and efforts to support the documentation of endangered languages and linguistic practices, and furthermore the active participation of speech communities in the documentation process (Himmelmann, 1998; Rice, 2011). This is reflected in the emergence of journals, conferences and workshops, as well as funding agencies and programs dedicated to supporting the discipline of language documentation.\nDespite these encouraging developments, the lack of “guidelines and metrics for evaluating data creation, curation, sharing, and re-use” (Berez-Kroeker et al., 2018) poses a significant challenge for practitioners of language documentation, who often struggle to earn recognition from the academic community for the documentary records that they produce (Riesberg, 2018), reflecting a discipline-specific manifestation of broader lack of recognition of the merit of open scholarship for review and hiring (Alperin et al. 2019). There is an expressed need specifically for peer-review of documentary outputs, but no established standards for doing so (Thieberger et al., 2016; LSA Executive Committee, 2018; Woodbury, 2014; Haspelmath and Michaelis, 2014).\nThe aim of this Special Collection of the Journal of Open Humanities Data (JOHD) is to develop a detailed outline of what an effective peer-review process for documentary materials might look like, and how such a system would foster better recognition for these materials in academic evaluation systems such as in hiring, promotion, and tenure. We welcome contributions that explore assessment criteria and procedures, as well as peer-authored reviews and curator-authored case studies of documentary materials.\nSubmissions on the following topics and related areas are encouraged:\n Articles discussing models of assessment for:   Applications of levels of access (e.g. Open Access, restricted access, sensitive materials, community access) and associated intellectual property information and reusability Data organization, quality of collection description, and artifact metadata Quantity, quality, and modality of the artifacts included in the collection File formats and software dependencies Comprehensiveness of the documentary record (e.g. diversity of speakers, speech genres, and speaker interactivity) Provenance of the collection, lifecycle and evolution of the data, version control and history, long-term preservation. Capacity for reuse of language documentation data for cross-disciplinary endeavors  Articles discussing assessment procedures and recognition, such as:   Contextual assessment which takes social, technological, and linguistic factors into account The roles of individual reviewers and/or authoritative bodies in conducting assessment and promoting recognition and reuse of materials Assessment by community members and other non-academic peers Internal assessment procedures in use by language archives Assessment at multiple developmental stages of the documentary record Labor issues and reward systems for performing assessments The role of assessment in improving recognition of documentary materials or contributing to the further development of the materials (i.e. users as curators) Variation in regional or national assessment standards  Peer-authored reviews or curator-authored case studies of documentary materials that illustrate or engage with one or more of the above points.  Submission Instructions All submissions should be 3,000-6,000 words in length (references not included), and will be considered full length research papers in the JOHD submission system. The deadline for submissions to this special collection is October 1st, 2021. Manuscripts will be sent for single-blind peer review after editorial consideration, and accepted papers will be published online in the journal’s special collection. Please follow the submission guidelines to submit your manuscript and please indicate that you are submitting to the special collection on Language Documentation in your cover letter.\nPlease note that there are Publication Fees for accepted papers. If you have any questions about fees, contact Anastasia Sakellariadi at a.sakellariadi@ubiquitypress.com.

The small number of terms (set size) and their apparent clarity to linguists are some of the great aspects of OLAC, where content creators are often the ones who also are cataloging the materials. Of the 29 OLAC subject terms listed in the OLAC documentation, the documentation indicates that 22 of them are matched to LCSH terms. Generally the OLAC note says: \u0026ldquo;The category is equivalent to the Library of Congress subject heading of the same name.\u0026rdquo; However, no specific LCSH term is specified. This creates problems for libraries who might otherwise use their LCSH terms to propagate OLAC terminologies for use in the OLAC aggregator.\nSeveral examples are worth mentioning:\n  phonology. The OLAC term for phonology says that there is no equivalent term in the LCSH schema. I find this ridiculous, untrue, but yet understandable. Within the LCSH system Phonology is a topical subdivision term. Meaning it is a \u0026ldquo;morpheme\u0026rdquo; which combines with qualified topic terms. So, the concept exists within the LCSH system, but not independently. The most general phonology term in the LCSH system is a complex term Grammar, Comparative and general--Phonology which does not have a referenceable URI, further complicating equivalency mappings in crosswalks.  lexicography The OLAC term for phonology says that it is equivalent same term in the LCSH schema. However, there are two terms in LCSH for Lexicography. It is not clear which one OLAC means. As mentioned previously, LCSH terms exist in different classes (roots and \u0026ldquo;derivation\u0026rdquo; morphemes). The root topic concept is sh85076357, but the general subdivision one would is sh99005001. It is probable that OLAC refers to the topic (root) rather than the general subdivision term. However, for clarity these things should be overtly stated.1,2  philosophy_of_language. It is entirely unclear which LCSH was seen as corresponding to OLAC\u0026rsquo;s philosophy_of_language subject tag. The OLAC documentation suggests: \u0026ldquo;The category is equivalent to the Library of Congress subject heading of the same name.\u0026rdquo; However, I become confused as there does not seem to be an exact match at the Library of Congress. The closest terms I can find within the LCSH terms are as follows: Philosophy (a topic term), Linguistics\u0026ndash;Philosophy (a complex term; linguistics is the topic and the sub-topic is philosophy), Language and languages\u0026ndash;Philosophy (the sub-topic philosophy is used under a different topic Language and languages), or in my opinion the least likely case Ordinary-language philosophy.  For the OLAC subjects I have looked at already, the following table lists what I hypothesis as being the OLAC intended equivalent. I haven\u0026rsquo;t worked my way through the whole table yet. When I have worked through the whole set of OLAC terms I will present this data in a more beautiful way.

That is, within the European Union (but also elsewhere) there has been a major push to make research outputs Open Access. Often in this context the presupposition is that the research is being conducted as part of federal/national government organizations such as institutes or universities. However, other organizational structures exist both within Europe and elsewhere. For instance, research may be conducted at a private corporation, by a non-profit organization, or by a private university, or by an unaffiliated individual. The push for Open Access has often been positioned within a narrative, that access to and reuse of government funded research outputs should not become encumbered by legal constraints. The ensuing argument then for linguistic research, which is often grant funded by governments is that the \u0026ldquo;ethical approach to research\u0026rdquo; is that the research outputs are costlessly accessible and unencumbered in their re-use.\nThere are several frameworks which establish rights within the EU context. However, the primary one which has been addressed in the literature and is presented as an encumberment to \u0026ldquo;research\u0026rdquo; is the copyright framework. To address encumberments by the copyright framework and other ethical considerations, the FAIR guidelines were developed. FAIR addresses the copyright consideraction through the suggestion of using creative commons licenses. This essentially releases copyright liability which is automatically applied via the copyright framework. This is usually done through a Creative Commons license, applied by the work\u0026rsquo;s creator. However, two major issues with this strategy seem to not be addressed by the larger publishing (and equally applicable to all research outputs) and distribution networks.\n  Addressing the Work-for-Hire doctrine where the research was conducted as part of the work a researcher was hired to do for an organization. That is, an author (researcher at a university) does not have the right to apply a creative commons license to their authored works, rather, it is their employer who holds this right. What is vastly under-expressed in the academic creative commons licensed literature is how the rights of the employing organizations are being curtailed.\n  The second issue with some creative commons licensed works is the use of the \u0026ldquo;non-commercial\u0026rdquo; clause. This clause has no discrete definition. As such it is not clear how it should or should not be applied. But applied especially in the context of academic business activities.\n  This set of references tracts some of the issues which are raised under the first point above. The application of the employer–employee contract in the context of academic institutions.\nReferences    Boutsikari (2015)  Boutsikari,\u0026#32; C. \u0026#32; (2015). \u0026#32;Who Owns the Academic Work?

The requests often go like this:\n Greetings, I\u0026rsquo;m writing because I am just about to head out to do field work for my degree and I\u0026rsquo;m wondering if you have any advice on the latest audio recorders for linguistic fieldwork.\n My response is invariably to pivot and respond to the question by asking what sort of products they would like to make. That is, linguists need to think about what can be done with the recordings, and how they need to influence the audio product\u0026rsquo;s creation and future use.\nMaking good audio recordings is about making recordings someone will want to listen to again, and again, and again. Invariably researchers (linguists) will listen to their recordings over and over again as they transcribe them. However their recordings gain value when others also want to listen to them. I recently was listening to a presentation where the presenter from Brazil, demonstrated some audio recordings from his field work. He showed a picture of the recording set up. In the picture it showed that he was using a Zoom H4n. In the recordings it was evident that the gain on the mics was pumped really high. The picture showed that he was using the built in mics. In the recording, the background noise was really full front while the speaker was perceptually distant — the chicken and the noise floor (the sound of \u0026ldquo;air\u0026rdquo; in the recording) were louder than the language speaker. Controlling for these factors are fundamental issues in basic crafting of audio recordings. Craftsmen (and women) who appreciate their art will get the tools they need to make their art (and artifacts) usable and enjoyable. This presenter from Brazil, played a recording from a language in which there are only about 8 speakers left\u0026hellip; linguistically the language is already like a classic car with low mileage—RARE. However, a good recording of a rare language is like a classic car dipped in gold. Microphone choice and placement allows the audio craftsman to tune down the gain, get closer to the subject and thereby record at levels where the signal to noise ratio (the sound of \u0026ldquo;air\u0026rdquo;) and the chickens are not heard in the recording or are perceptively in the far background rather than in the foreground1. The ability to attenuate a listener to specific parts of the audio stream is where the artistry and the skill comes into full view. It is this applied artistry that makes audio recordings valued and worth listing to over and over.\nIn contrast to audio craftsmen, linguists are generally not interested in good sounding audio, they are only interested in completing their dissertation or the next published article which proves their theoretical hypothesis or generates points with their tenure and promotion board. Audio artifacts (recordings) are not primary products of interest to a linguist, rather it is what is done with them that is of their concern. This whole approach to language recording militants against good audio recordings.\nOne linguist with whom I collaborated, when asked how they wanted to manage the recordings (both the technical aspect of production, and the file system organization of the recordings) was not concerned with either. That person was (at the time) ambivalent because their advisor was advising the PhD dissertation not some fieldwork project. That linguist\u0026rsquo;s goal wasn\u0026rsquo;t to produce a body of work (recordings) which could be used beyond the dissertation, the goal was to do enough fieldwork to complete the dissertation.\nFrom the advisor\u0026rsquo;s perspective, as long as the fieldwork produced some written data to present in the dissertation the core requirements were satisfied. I followed the career of that linguist and now they are in a post-doc at a reputable organization. The post-doc was advertised pre-COVID and included funding for fieldwork. However, due to COVID this linguist has relied on their prior field recordings in (presumably) unexpected ways. The organization and quality of the recordings impacts their productivity as they now need to reference those recordings. Within the context of the current post-doc and the global climate, job performance productivity is not evaluated as being above average or below average. However, the career building blocks for the next post-doc or position is impacted, by how the fieldwork situation and production process was managed, and the quality of the product produced. I notice that career scholars produce about four publications a year in addition to the grants that they write and win. This is a very different interactive context than negotiating interpersonal relationships on a funded project (in a lab or in a village).\nAs a audio craftsman, I use an an MMaudio DPSM-SIL mic or one of two Røde M3 mics with a Zoom H4n digital audio recorder. The MMaudio mic is a special set up of the mmdpsm mic with longer cords (7 feet). To order it one must call the company because they don\u0026rsquo;t put the part on-line. I think there are a few other tweaks with the DPSM-SIL and the regularly advertised DPSM.\n Do not use Phantom power with the DPSM-SIL there is a setting through the menu of the Zoom H4n that says \u0026ldquo;plug-in power\u0026rdquo;. Turn this on. Also be careful of plugging in the mic into things like computers. I do not know what specific computer\u0026rsquo;s mic jack setting are but they might over power the mic and damage it.\n There are technical reasons related to mic sensitivity and faithfulness to the input which lead me to choose these two mics in 2008. However, for me the ability to plan how audio should sound and the ability to create \u0026ldquo;three dimensional texture\u0026rdquo; within the audio recording is more important than a specific microphone2.\nAs a craftsman I also suggest the use of headphones because live recordings need active monitoring. Hearing the recording is import to the production production process — what is on the recording is not what is heard in the recording environment. See my write up on headphones I have used here: https://hugh.thejourneyler.org/2011/headphones-for-language-documentation\n  I found a different audio recording in a language archive which demonstrates the \u0026ldquo;air\u0026rdquo; and high-pitch noise induced into the recording. Presumably the high frequency pitch comes from the computer fan which is running nearby while recording. However, given the date of recording it might be the noise of the tape deck. The archive record does not make clear the original medium of recordings. From a sound engineer\u0026rsquo;s point of view, this is not great recording because the noise to signal ratio is really out of proportion. The recording is by Laurent Fontaine. Created in 2005. Titled: Histoire de Kanumá. https://doi.org/10.24397/pangloss-0000495 \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n I also inevitiably get asked about USB mics and mics which plug into mobile phones or tablets. I find that these tools are not worth the money or the added risks they bring to workflow managment. There are some cool features and I have used plugin devices with iOS for recording as backups. The major issue with USB plugin mics is fan noise from the computer. People often look at podcasters and say \u0026ldquo;but they are using USB mics\u0026rdquo;. To which I say, \u0026ldquo;are you making a podcast, from the far bedroom in your home in the USA? What kind of post processing do you plan on doing?\u0026rdquo; I found a really well written article which discusses these issues: https://www.lowdownpublishing.com/post/musicians-guide-for-video-conferencing . \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n   ","date":1621604145,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1621604145,"objectID":"0b4683dac8b2ac32a77fe6986d1b9878","permalink":"https://hughandbecky.us/Hugh-CV/post/microphone-recommendations/","publishdate":"2021-05-21T14:35:45+01:00","relpermalink":"/Hugh-CV/post/microphone-recommendations/","section":"post","summary":"Language Documentation microphone and headphone recommendations.","tags":["Microphones","Hardware","Language Documentation"],"title":"Microphone Recommendations","type":"post"},{"authors":["Hugh Paterson III"],"categories":["Research Note","Jot"],"content":"While working on a description of the Eastern Dan writing system I found it challenging to keep track of all the different writing system evolutions and the various materials produced in each writing system. As I listen to the challenges faced in various linguistic projects (archiving, OCR, language revitalization, corpus creation) around the world, which work with written linguistic materials I find that they also often have the same basic problems. That is, the same language may be written with different transcription systems. There is currently no clear and concise way to create an identifier for language transcription systems. Some have turned to the ISO 639-3 to say \u0026ldquo;the writing system of x language\u0026rdquo;, however this is often not descriptive enough. The BCP47 identifier is much more descriptive and useful in this context.\nI use the term writing system rather than orthography because orthography is narrowly construed in technological contexts. That is, orthography applies to spelling, while writing system applies to the characters used to communicate in a given language (Citation: Constable,\u0026#32; 2002) Constable,\u0026#32; P. \u0026#32; (2002). \u0026#32;Toward a Model for Language Identification Defining an ontology of language-related categories. SIL Electronic Working Papers,\u0026#32;2002-003.\u0026#32;Retrieved from\u0026#32; https://www.sil.org/resources/publications/entry/7853  . Sometimes a writing system revision implies or necessitates an orthography change, sometimes it doesn\u0026rsquo;t. When an orthography change adds or removes a character (Unicode character) from the language it also implies a writing system change.\nThese relationships are illustrated in the following graph replicated from (Citation: Constable,\u0026#32; 2002) Constable,\u0026#32; P. \u0026#32; (2002). \u0026#32;Toward a Model for Language Identification Defining an ontology of language-related categories. SIL Electronic Working Papers,\u0026#32;2002-003.\u0026#32;Retrieved from\u0026#32; https://www.sil.org/resources/publications/entry/7853  .\n  For example the following languages and their writing system histories demonstrate some of the complexities which a catalog of writing system evolutions would need to consider.\nTarok The Tarok orthography falls in the category of an SIL revision in 1976 of a missionary orthography first produced in 1919. Tarok people did a comprehensive revision in 2018, covering alphabets and rules of the writing system. Tarok [ISO 639-3: yer] is spoken Central Nigeria.\nDan Dan is a language of Liberia and the Ivory coast [ISO 639-3: dnj]. It requires three BCP47 tags to distinguish the language-writing system combinations, because there are three writing systems one in Liberia, one for Eastern Dan, one for Western Dan. Historically, Dan-Kla [ISO 639-3: lda] now recognized as a separate language, was also lumped in with Dan, the ISO 639-3 registrar addressed this in 2013.\nEastern Dan Within the Dan example Eastern Dan has a history of 5 writing system versions, some with SIL involvement, some without. These are writing system revisions, not orthography revisions because the glyphs used in each case were different. It wasn’t just the spelling system that changed, it what the character repertoire needed to write the language.\nMe\u0026rsquo;phaa Me\u0026rsquo;phaa is a set of 4 ISO 639-3 languages but the Mexican government acknowledges something like 7 unique languages. They all share one writing system but spell words how they pronounce them in their respective regions. This means that there is one writing system, but several orthographies. As far as I know no orthography is standardized.\nGerman Four countries, various different writing systems (glyphs), countries have discrete version histories, but conceded that they have one language.\nTem A language which uses both Ajami and Latin scripts.\nWith these kinds of issues in mind, I crafted the following fictitious statement which exemplifies some of the things for which a good catalog of writing system versions would account.\n  Bibliography   Constable (2002)  Constable,\u0026#32; P. \u0026#32; (2002). \u0026#32;Toward a Model for Language Identification Defining an ontology of language-related categories.

How can we do that?\nOne might be tempted to import the .flextext file into FLEx so that it can be re-exported with the XLingPaper exports from the FLEx menus, but this is not really a viable option becasue if we import that FLExText to an empty FLEx database, FLEx will not import the morpheme level annotations — it will recognize the free-translation and the baseline text. Bascially anything which is related to the lexicon part of the database is not viewable in the imported database.\nHowever all is not lost we can use the XSLT transforms from FLEx by copying them to a usable location as the data start of those transforms is also .flextext.\nI run linux.

Discoverability metadata, a subset of archived resource metadata, serves aggregators like OLAC by declaring a resource exists. In contrast, bibliographic metadata functions within documents by declaring where to find a resource that is known to exist.In this thesis I look at the interaction between Zotero, an open source reference manager, five different archives (PARADISEC, Pangloss, SIL Language \u0026 Culture Archives, ELAR, and Kaipuleohone), and three methods of importing metadata from them into Zotero (DOI import, HTML embedded metadata, and file based import). I report on collection and audio artifact metadata provided by the archive to the author via Zotero’s interfaces: what’s included, what’s missing, and what’s misaligned.Understanding the processes by which authors collect metadata for the purpose of citation and referencing, what metadata they need, and if it is being provided, facilitates the design of useful interfaces to archives which elevate the value of archives to all groups who interact with them. I propose that interaction design is an additional factor to those presented by Chang (2010) in her well received checklist for evaluating language archives.Interaction design, the technical field concerned with designing how people interact with objects and services, is the design process by which archives manage the interactions they have with those they serve. I specifically argue that interaction design adds value to an archive’s brand, as perceived by the network of archive users, when it facilitates the interaction with bibliographic metadata about artifacts within holdings. This added value speaks to the sustainability of an archive within its sphere of influence. It is increasingly important in the career development of scholars to meet metric-based assessments of their influence in scholarly discussions. Reference counts, including those pointing to the evidentiary record housed in archives, play a significant role in establishing quantitative baseline metrics for scholars.","tags":["Archive","Zotero","Metadata"],"title":"Language Archive Records: Interoperability of Referencing Practices and Metadata Models","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Hugh Paterson III"],"categories":["Bibliography","Jot"],"content":"The Open Language Archives Community (OLAC) metadata profile is built on Dublin Core and OAI.

A trip to the library was in order to discover what sort of resources are out there to be consulted. A few years ago I ran across the Journal of Inklings Studies which was focused on all authors who were part of the writers circle, Inklings, which included J.R.R. Tolkien and C.S. Lewis. The series of journals to consult appear below. In addition there are newsletters from various societies which are not listed.\n  Tolkien Journal  Mythlore ; Community home page  Tolkien Studies: An Annual Scholarly Review  Mallorn — journal of the Tolkien Society  Journal of Inklings Studies ; masthead  Journal of Tolkien Research  ","date":1617398078,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1617398078,"objectID":"122bb81d847b972f889f09fc35520872","permalink":"https://hughandbecky.us/Hugh-CV/post/tolkien-studies/","publishdate":"2021-04-02T14:14:38-07:00","relpermalink":"/Hugh-CV/post/tolkien-studies/","section":"post","summary":"Some pointers in academic Tolkien studies.","tags":["Tolkien",""],"title":"Tolkien-Studies","type":"post"},{"authors":["Hugh Paterson III"],"categories":["Professional Note"],"content":"For several years I have been tracking the progression of how interlinear glossed texts (IGT) are interacted with online. This has several dimensions:\n the reason for the interaction and the goals of the interaction the visual layout and concepts driving the interaction the supporting technology choices used to make these interactions happen also the content of glosses used in the texts.  With regard to the first point above, I find that corpus tools generally fall into one of three broad catagories and this holds true even for browser based tools: Crafting, Display \u0026amp; Navigation, and Information Extraction \u0026amp; Pattern Discovery. Even though EXMARaLDA is not a browser based corpus too these catagories are exemplified in its documentation:\n EXMARaLDA is a system for working with oral corpora on a computer. It consists of a transcription and annotation tool (Partitur-Editor), a tool for managing corpora (Corpus-Manager) and a query and analysis tool (EXAKT)\n I have used this three way distinction to catagorize some of the different software options available for browser based interactions with IGT data1.\n  Types of browser based tools Credit: Hugh Paterson III     While what is presented in terms of the content is still very important, how it is presented in an interactive mode is also important. That is, how is the experience crafted around the audio or video and the transcribed segments in terms of the interaction design and visual design? I started to compile a list of these interactions which I present below. However, two significant components are influential in the life cycle of software and hence these interactions. First, the viral nature of the interaction, i.e., how easy is it to propagate the interaction in new contexts. Second, what is the life cycle of the technology undergirding the browser based experience? That is, how does the technology choice expose the user to obsolecence and technolgical debt. These two factors should be top ranking considerations when a project desires to \u0026ldquo;publish\u0026rdquo; or present interlinear texts online. In addition to these two factors, the following three design considerations will also impact the sustainability and maintainability of the online presence for the corpora and ought to be considered while planning for implementation.\n The first consideration is, is there a required separation between data (content) and presentation? By separating on these lines the code produced to present the interlinear text can be re-used liberally across texts and projects, and the visual presentation can be adjusted and applied to texts at scale. The second consideration is, what is the quantity of dependencies that a visual presentation requires? That is, are there server based requirements for the generation of the visual presentation, or can the presentation happen without the server? Server based presentations require a long term maintenance plan. More dependencies require that the software be updated as each dependency evolves (potentially motivated by security issues). Dependencies may drop features that current interactions deemed important. The third consideration is what is the purpose of the web-presentation? There are different classes of tools with respect to interlinear glossed texts. Arguably, the one of primary importance is the archived version. That is, where is the text archived and can the archived version\u0026rsquo;s annotation be viewed while the audio is heard at the same time. A secondary consideration then is the working copy, or what can one do with the interlinear glossed text and how easy is it for people other than the author of the interlinear glossed text to do comparative searching across the text or in conjunction with other texts. Then a third consideration, is how is the canonical reference of the archived version persisted through to the working copy. That is, if the interlinear glossed text it loaded into an online system for investigation, does that system create new identifiers for the searches conducted or does it respect existing identifiers?  With these issues in mind I have been collecting images of the visual presentation of interlinear glossed texts online. In addition to my purpose for looking at ongoing evolution of the technical presentation of interlinear glossed text, I have been looking for a system that meets the requirements of points number one and two for use on a portfolio website like mine. Stated another way, I am looking for a tool which takes ELAN or FLExTexts and matches them with audio or video in the browser, rather than on a server. I want the tool to be limited to HTML5, JavaScript, and CSS3+.\nThis is just a short list of tools for presenting time-aligned texts online. These would be in the middle category of the illustration above as they are designed for presentation and discovery of the resource rather than information extraction2.\nRequires no Database Leipzig.js Produced by: Ben Chauvette Links: https://bdchauvette.net/leipzig.js ; Github, npm package. Notes: This JavaScript library lines up interliear glosses based on spaces in the text file. Each row must be its own HTML paragraph. It can then number them for use as examples. It does not connect the the text to audio or video files, but it is great for use on blogs and websites. Glosser is a similar kind of product, written in jQuery (JavaScript), but in my quick 3.5 minute review it looks like Leipzig.js has more features than Glosser.

However, the files are completly accessable for grabbing and subsequent modification. The setup currently uses wavesurfer.js for media interaction and .vtt files, which are type of sub-title file. In an alternative to using to the use of .vtt files is to use an existing wavesurfer.js plugin built for use with ELAN files. One major difference between these presentations is the orientation of the table which presents the interlinear glossed texts.\n  wavesurfer.js + ELAN Produced by: J. Reuben Wetherbee Links: https://wavesurfer-js.org/example/elan/index.html ; https://wavesurfer-js.org/example/elan-wave-segment/index.html Notes: The ELAN plugin to wavesurfer.js was authored by J. Reuben Wetherbee. It appears in the wavesurfer.js documentation examples, but not in the main site\u0026rsquo;s list of plugins. Video.js is another project which can display video and text tracts. There is also a plugin which connects video.js to wavesurfer.js [ Github repo ]. So it seems that there might be a possibility to use one of either of these methods to present text annotations from ELAN and video together. However, I have not found any examples of this yet.\n  Require Back-end Databases Ethnographic E-Research Online Presentation System (EOPAS) Produced by: Nick Thieberger (Citation: Schroeter et al.,\u0026#32; 2006) Schroeter,\u0026#32; R.\u0026#32;\u0026amp;\u0026#32;Thieberger,\u0026#32; N. \u0026#32; (2006). \u0026#32;EOPAS, the EthnoER online representation of interlinear text.\u0026#32;In\u0026#32;Barwick,\u0026#32; L.\u0026#32;\u0026amp;\u0026#32;Thieberger,\u0026#32; N.

The same purpose of this service could be accomplished if ELAN annotations were under version control (like git) and collaborators interacted with version control and used ELAN on their local computers.\nMulticast Produced by: Geoffrey Haig \u0026amp; Nils Norman Schiborr (Citation: Haig et al.,\u0026#32; 2016) Haig,\u0026#32; G.\u0026#32;\u0026amp;\u0026#32;Schiborr,\u0026#32; N. \u0026#32; (2016). \u0026#32;Multi-CAST (Multilingual Corpus of Annotated Spoken Texts): Ein Projekt zur Erstellung und Auswertung mehrsprachiger Korpora für die Sprachtypologie.    Links: https://multicast.aspra.uni-bamberg.de  Notes: The presentation software does not seem to be open source and accessible. However there is an open source R package which one can use to download annotation files and programatically investigate them. The text being played in the audio is not highlighted, but one can quickly access the transcribed text and copy it out as formatted LaTeX for inclusion as interlinear text in an other document (a pretty nifty feature).   Audio is at the very bottom of the screen. The text is not highlighted as it is played.

It is developed in PHP and requires a server. It was developed in response to perceptions of server lag times in early versions of Pangloss (in the presentation interface managed by Villejuif; there are two interfaces). These versions of Pangloss converted ELAN files (XML) to HTML on request. As these XML files got longer they affected server-client transmission times. Technicians opted to parse these XML files into a databases to decrease load times. This is an interesting use of tools because the XML transforms could have been maintained and the HTML outputs cached or retained until XML files were updated. The alternative strategy would have not introduced PHP into the set of software required for the presentation.\nReferences   Beermann\u0026#32;\u0026amp;\u0026#32;Mihaylov (2014)  Beermann,\u0026#32; D.\u0026#32;\u0026amp;\u0026#32;Mihaylov,\u0026#32; P. \u0026#32; (2014). \u0026#32;TypeCraft collaborative databasing and resource sharing for linguists.

In some cases he may not be wrong at all as much field work in the 20th century was conducted by missionaries. Missionaries often have a primary purpose which can often be cast as \u0026ldquo;social work\u0026rdquo;. But even outside of the context of the \u0026ldquo;missionary-linguist\u0026rdquo; field work is often conducted in contexts which follow human relationships. So even outside of \u0026ldquo;missionary-linguistics\u0026rdquo; much of the language-documentation movement has seen as its goal the up-lifting of ethno-linguistic communities by supporting their language development and community identity goals. For example, many point to Michael Krauss\u0026rsquo;s (Citation: Hale et al.,\u0026#32; 1992) Hale,\u0026#32; K.,\u0026#32; Krauss,\u0026#32; M.,\u0026#32; Watahomigie,\u0026#32; L.,\u0026#32; Yamamoto,\u0026#32; A.,\u0026#32; Craig,\u0026#32; C.,\u0026#32; Jeanne,\u0026#32; L.\u0026#32;\u0026amp;\u0026#32;England,\u0026#32; N. \u0026#32; (1992). \u0026#32;Endangered Languages.

Krauss\u0026rsquo;s plea certainly was responded positively by many in the linguistic science community, e.g., (Citation: Goodfellow,\u0026#32; 2009) Goodfellow,\u0026#32; A. \u0026#32; (2009). \u0026#32;Introduction.\u0026#32;In\u0026#32;Goodfellow,\u0026#32; A.

Let’s cut to the chase, “linguistic social work” (Citation: Newman,\u0026#32; 2003) Newman,\u0026#32; P. \u0026#32; (2003). \u0026#32;The endangered languages issue as a hopeless cause.\u0026#32;In\u0026#32;Janse,\u0026#32; M.\u0026#32;\u0026amp;\u0026#32;Tol,\u0026#32; S.

After working with a linguist, a language “community” might have a few resources in their language, a new orthography, or recordings of their traditional stories in an archive, but now the piper needs to be paid. The economic currency of academia is reference counts.\n While I pondered, nearly napping, over many a quaint and curious article of forgotten scholarship\u0026hellip; I asked the question \u0026ldquo;is linguistic social work\u0026rdquo; a term which may have links to other ideas about social activism in the academy? Other follow-on questions also ensued. These articulated themselves like: So what other ways are there to be an \u0026ldquo;activist\u0026rdquo; and a \u0026ldquo;researcher\u0026rdquo;? and also What other ideologies are there and what approaches might be related to the ideas of \u0026ldquo;activism\u0026rdquo;? after all what is this idea of \u0026ldquo;activism\u0026rdquo;? Is it not \u0026ldquo;research with social impact\u0026rdquo;? Social impact through activism seems to be asking the question: \u0026ldquo;Given the current state of social networks what activities need to be conducted to change the make-up of social networks or the power structure of the existing social networks? This begins to sound, at least to me, like the fundamental goals of counterinsurgency (COIN) operations.\nIt seems like a reasonable follow on question about activism and the academy then would be: Is activism any different than scholarship as diplomacy? Is scholarship as diplomacy evolved to the point where it is diplomacy to non-state actors? I might go out on a limb here but my knee jerk reaction is that, ultimately diplomacy to non-state actors must or should involve COIN (Counterinsurgency) methodology (or whatever COIN evolves into).\nA couple of resources I found on these topics along with those cited above are presented in the bibliography below.\nBibliography   Acar\u0026#32;\u0026amp;\u0026#32;Coşkan (2020)  Acar,\u0026#32; Y.\u0026#32;\u0026amp;\u0026#32;Coşkan,\u0026#32; C. \u0026#32; (2020). \u0026#32;Academic activism and its impact on individual-level mobilization, sources of learning, and the future of academia in Turkey.

In contrast to the coalescence of corpus and collection, Thieberger (Citation: Thieberger,\u0026#32; 2018) Thieberger,\u0026#32; N. \u0026#32; (2018). \u0026#32;Texts and more texts: corpora in the CoEDL\u0026nbsp;[Blog].\u0026nbsp;Endangered Languages and Cultures.\u0026#32;Retrieved from\u0026#32; https://www.paradisec.org.au/blog/2018/02/texts-and-more-texts-corpora-in-the-coedl/  , in a blog post, credits Jane Simpson with proposing the following terms: Assemblage – all material collected, working files, early sources, multiple versions and drafts; Collection – the archived material, a subset of the above, but curated with sufficient metadata to allow the user to know what all items are; Corpus – a crafted set of texts in the language that can be used for further analysis. For a recent treatment of these ideas see Sullivant (Citation: Sullivant,\u0026#32; 2020) Sullivant,\u0026#32; R. \u0026#32; (2020). \u0026#32;Archival description for language documentation collections.

I am not convinced that the distinction between assemblage and collection is relevant for a variety of reasons. But my interests are specifically how the distinction might impact the crafting of a bibliographic reference. I suggest that reference formulations do not need to be different between an assemblage and a collection.\nLest I leave the definitions distinguishing a corpus and a collection undisputed, let me suggest some pragmatic distinctions. Biber (Citation: Biber,\u0026#32; 1993) Biber,\u0026#32; D. \u0026#32; (1993). \u0026#32;Using Register-Diversified Corpora for General Language Studies.

Literary and Linguistic Computing,\u0026#32;8(4).\u0026#32;243–257. https://doi.org/10.1093/llc/8.4.243  set up diversity-based criteria for corpus design. One interpretation of Biber’s work is that if a body of evidence does not meet the diversity threshold then it does not qualify as a corpus. The diversity dynamic as a goal for a set of materials generated through language documentation efforts has been a long standing tenant of creating an evidence based documentary record for a language (Citation: Himmelmann,\u0026#32; 1998) Himmelmann,\u0026#32; N. \u0026#32; (1998). \u0026#32;Documentary and Descriptive Linguistics. Linguistics,\u0026#32;36(1).\u0026#32;161–195. https://doi.org/10.1515/ling.1998.36.1.161  . Biber’s diversity arguments have even been suggested as guidelines for guiding elicitation in language documentation (Citation: Lüpke,\u0026#32; 2010) Lüpke,\u0026#32; F. \u0026#32; (2010). \u0026#32;Research methods in language documentation. Language Documentation and Description,\u0026#32;7.\u0026#32;55–104.  . In this sense it is clear that selection is a process which impacts both corpus design and what is collected during fieldwork. However, a second useful criterion for defining a corpus (in contrast to a collection) might be that there is an existing tool set which can be used to exploit the collection of artifacts as a single work. This could lead to an interpretation that a corpus is more like a dataset in the Dublin Core sense, while a collection is more like a collection in the Dublin Core sense—and indeed we see that (Citation: Xia et al.,\u0026#32; 2016) Xia,\u0026#32; F.,\u0026#32; Lewis,\u0026#32; W.,\u0026#32; Goodman,\u0026#32; M.,\u0026#32; Slayden,\u0026#32; G.,\u0026#32; Georgi,\u0026#32; R.,\u0026#32; Crowgey,\u0026#32; J.\u0026#32;\u0026amp;\u0026#32;Bender,\u0026#32; E. \u0026#32; (2016). \u0026#32;Enriching a massively multilingual database of interlinear glossed text.

Both datasets (of which databases are a type) and collections can be considered examples of aggregate works. I realize that linguists and language materials archivists have applied these labels loosely but I side with Society of American Archivists, rule 2.3.19 (Citation: ,\u0026#32; 2013) \u0026#32; (2013). \u0026#32;Describing archives: a content standard (2nd). \u0026#32; Society of American Archivists.\u0026#32;Retrieved from\u0026#32; http://files.archivists.org/pubs/DACS2E-2013_v0315.pdf  in its suggested distinguishing terms for the highest level of an archival unit of materials: “Archival materials are frequently described by devised aggregate terms such as papers (for personal materials), records (for organizational materials), or collection (for topical aggregations)” (see (Citation: Wahbeh,\u0026#32; 2009) Wahbeh,\u0026#32; F.(2009,\u0026#32;8/10).\u0026#32;Retrieved from\u0026#32; https://blogs.cul.columbia.edu/schapiro/2009/08/10/on-records-papers-and-collection-a-dacs-case-in-point/  for an example of application). There are other terms which still need to be fleshed out among language archive practitioners such as: archival deposit, accession, and what one might call an artifact and its associated metadata file.\nBibliography   Good (2011)  Good,\u0026#32; J. \u0026#32; (2011). \u0026#32;Data and language documentation.\u0026#32;In\u0026#32;Austin,\u0026#32; P.\u0026#32;\u0026amp;\u0026#32;Sallabank,\u0026#32; J.

By and large when I hear people talking about \u0026ldquo;language documentation\u0026rdquo; 25 years after Himmelmann\u0026rsquo;s approach was stated, I don\u0026rsquo;t see the large scale wide topic and social contribution \u0026ldquo;corpus building\u0026rdquo; activities. Rather I see many PhD scopped projects, 1-3 year grant funded projects with particular interests in a anthopological or grammatical theme, etc. Therefore the material created today, and perahps since 1998, has not really fit the definitions that these early authors are assuming are true. That is there has been semantic drift around the useage of the term \u0026ldquo;language documentation\u0026rdquo; as it applies to linguistic field work and its outputs. Perahps these other outputs are better classified as digital linguistics. \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n   ","date":1610959298,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1610959298,"objectID":"51f02f4395c017aa9044703d4701a14c","permalink":"https://hughandbecky.us/Hugh-CV/post/corpora-collections-dataset/","publishdate":"2021-03-21T01:41:38-07:00","relpermalink":"/Hugh-CV/post/corpora-collections-dataset/","section":"post","summary":"There has been some discussion of what constitutes a collection among language documentation practitioners.

I could take a screenshot save it as a .png or .jpg and call it good. However these sorts of images do not provide a great deal of resolution and do not look clean in a published paper. Especially when dealing with screenshots as the resolution is not very high — at least in my experince. I could print the web page to PDF but a post-script style PDF would basically create an image and wrap it in a PDF. This is not really any better than the screenshot solution.\nWith a quick internet search I uncovered two potential solutions: wkhtmltopdf and WebVector/CSSBox. I decided to try out wkhtmltopdf. It was simple and easy to install on linux. It produces great resutls with a bit of tinkering ( manual here). Though it should be noted that wkhtmltopdf is based on webkit which has mostly not seen progressive development. I also tried WebVector (specifically on the website Pangloss) and it did not produce expected results.\nPlaying around with wkhtmltopdf I was able to produce a PDF of several webpages I was looking to include. I used the following workflow after install:\nI adjusted my screen size to fit the type of display I wanted. Then I measured it via whatismyviewport.com. I took that and made it my viewport size. Then I played around with my output settings for the PDF. I knew that I wanted really low margins because I was going to embed this PDF as a figure in another PDF. Then I continued to play around with the page size to find the cut-off point between the content I wanted and the footer. In the end the code I used looked like this:\nwkhtmltopdf --no-print-media-type --viewport-size 1100 --page-height 6.25in --page-width 7.75in -T 1mm -B 1mm -R 1mm -L 1mm --load-media-error-handling skip --enable-javascript --javascript-delay 2000 https://www.sil.org/resources/archives/52216 sil-item.pdf\nwkhtmltopdf --no-print-media-type --viewport-size 1100 --page-height 8in --page-width 7.75in -T 1mm -B 1mm -R 1mm -L 1mm --load-media-error-handling skip --enable-javascript --javascript-delay 2000 https://scholarspace.manoa.hawaii.edu/handle/10125/30788 K-item.pdf\nwkhtmltopdf --no-print-media-type --viewport-size 1100 --page-height 8.75in --page-width 7in -T 1mm -B 1mm -R 1mm -L 1mm --load-media-error-handling skip --enable-javascript --javascript-delay 2000 http://www.language-archives.org/item/oai:sil.org:52216 olac-item1.pdf\nThis produced a nice PDF. But I needed to get rid of the second page. I did this with PDF-Shuffler and just deleted the second page. I wanted to include the final PDF in XLingPaper which uses XeLaTeX on the back end. However one of the current dependencies only allows PDFs of version 1.4 or older. So I had to \u0026ldquo;back version\u0026rdquo; the PDF version to 1.4. I the following code (adjustin for file names) to do that.\ngs -q -sDEVICE=pdfwrite -dCompatibilityLevel=1.4 -o out.pdf in.pdf My suspicion though is that passing the PDF through GhostSript also removes some of the mark-up features which already exist in the PDF via wkhtmltopdf. This may include some of the links and embedded fonts — but on this last point I am not 100 percent sure.\nIn an earlier version of this workflow I was using standard size pages (A4, A3, etc.). Doing so required that I then cut the PDF so that the usable portion was able to usefully be scaled in xlingpaper. To do this I used pdfresizer.com to reduce the physical dimensions of pdf paes.

The broad idea is that humans are impacted by the things in their environment and form special \u0026ldquo;attachments\u0026rdquo; or relationships with those things. So my question was what sort of relationship do minority language users create with their language and how does the tool of a keyboard layout affect that relationship? We know that the kind of shovel available to someone digging a trench impacts how they approach the crafting of the trench, so in the same way what is the impact of one keyboard layout as opposed to a different one? The same question can be pose about two other \u0026ldquo;objects\u0026rdquo;. For example, consider a language\u0026rsquo;s orthography many would not consider this an \u0026ldquo;object\u0026rdquo; in the traditional sense, but yet people engage with it as if it were an object. I think this is significant not just for materiality studies but also social anthropology and the social use of language artifacts. The second object or set of objects was the content of a \u0026ldquo;language archive\u0026rdquo;. That is, the materiality of language artifacts. We see that these artifacts are important and do have social relationships as evidenced by the nature of relationships that indigenous communities in the USA have with various archives and speech related artifacts. It is not only these communities, it is broader than that. For example Mukurtu a CMS solution for digital engagement with cultural heritage artifacts has some wide spread uptake among indigenous communities outside of the USA. One implication of materiality considerations is that the relationships and specific attitudes about relationships are communicable without actually having material artifacts move across communities. This then has significant relevance for language development and language revitalization studies.\nThe following bibliography is a list of sources I started to collect on the topic.\nBibliography   Allen-Robertson (2018)  Allen-Robertson,\u0026#32; J. \u0026#32; (2018). \u0026#32;Critically assessing digital documents: materiality and the interpretative role of software.

Journal of Scientometric Research,\u0026#32;6(2).\u0026#32;109–118. https://doi.org/10.5530/jscires.6.2.16  .\nIf I use the same categories as the MIAR project there are nearly 1700 linguistic journals among the approximately 40,000 journals and serials tracked (Citation: Rodríguez-Gairín et al.,\u0026#32; 2011) Rodríguez-Gairín,\u0026#32; J.,\u0026#32; Somoza-Fernández,\u0026#32; M.\u0026#32;\u0026amp;\u0026#32;Urbano,\u0026#32; C. \u0026#32; (2011). \u0026#32;MIAR: hacia un entorno colaborativo de editores, autores y evaluadores de revistas. El Profesional de la Informacion,\u0026#32;20(5).\u0026#32;589–596. https://doi.org/10.3145/epi.2011.sep.15  . These journals may be currently active or may have ceased their publishing, or changed the name of the journal (increasing the number of serials counted).\nDefining the discipline is hard. For example, should one include the fields of Language Documentation, Anthropology, or Philology? Therefore the exact scope seems fuzzy but if we go with the 1700 number presented by the MIAR project it gives us a start. I have read several studies which focus on 10-year segment of a journal\u0026rsquo;s history (not linguistics) and they generally report that in a 10-year time span about 450 articles are produced. One approach would be to multiply 450 by 1700 and estimate the number of articles from there (765,000 articles). But this leaves us without knowing how many active journals there are.\nI have noticed that career linguists in the academy publish about three articles a year (more-or-less). Christopher Phipps, on his blog (Citation: Phipps,\u0026#32; 2010) Phipps,\u0026#32; C. \u0026#32; (2010). \u0026#32;How Many Linguists Are There? 5379.\u0026nbsp;[Blog].\u0026nbsp;The Lousy Linguist.\u0026#32;Retrieved from\u0026#32; https://thelousylinguist.blogspot.com/2010/03/how-many-linguists-are-there-5379.html  postulates that in 2010 there were about 5379 linguists. More-or-less this might give us a growth rate of about 16,000 articles per year. I recall reading somewhere that a major commercial linguistic bibliography added between 9,000 and 11,000 articles between its annual versions. Since we don\u0026rsquo;t anticipate complete coverage of by the team behind the bibliography it seems that the 16,000 number is closer to reasonable.\nIf we assume that the 16,000 number has been constant and covers the 765,000 total articles this gives us between 47 and 48 years of publishing history. Obviously the 765,000 number would be smaller than the total number of relevant language research publications (say since the 1500\u0026rsquo;s). But presumably the rate of publication growth is accelerating with innovations in publishing technology, the growth of the global population, and the growth of the academic and industrial application of language knowledge.\nStill another way of estimating how many articles are produced a year are to look at the rate of DOI usage or the growth of specific databases of articles. Not all journals or publishers use DOIs, and databases are also limited to those journals they index so it is not a fool-proof method but it would give us an approximate rate and a comparable rate with other disciplines. This method was attempted by (Citation: Larsen et al.,\u0026#32; 2010) Larsen,\u0026#32; P.\u0026#32;\u0026amp;\u0026#32;Ins,\u0026#32; M. \u0026#32; (2010). \u0026#32;The rate of growth in scientific publication and the decline in coverage provided by Science Citation Index.

Pragmatic need generally drives my wood working projects. Designers, talk about intentionality and how an object expresses some essence, but in wood working, I find design and engineering needs converge. While I am working on a project in the building phase, I am motivated by I how I think people are going to love to touch and look at the finished product. Bringing together form and function, design and engineering is why I love wood as a medium. Feeling the wood and imagining how others will feel the same thing defines my target level of performance when crafting. For my more pragmatic projects, like designers, I want the utility of the object to excel to the point where people don\u0026rsquo;t think about the object any more, it just exists and looks like it belongs in its space.\nShelves Custom built-ins   Bathroom built in shelf.

(and I did the stone work too!) Credit: Hugh Paterson III           Tables From coffee tables with places for kids things, to rebuilding missing parts for IKEA tables — tables are fun.     \nWorkbenches I\u0026rsquo;ve built two work tables (work benches). One is sort of a standing desk/table for my computers. While the other was a work bench for my brother\u0026rsquo;s garage, with space for shop-vac and tools underneath it. The computer table is custom designed for the set of computers I run and has space for the custom rack mounted server cart underneath it.   \n   Toys, Games, and Play-things My favorite things to make are small fun filling objects. My first \u0026ldquo;big\u0026rdquo; project was the chess set in 9th grade. My dad made me a truck for my second Christmas, I made my daughter a truck for her second Christmas. An unfinished dice box. And a box for our hand holds for the climbing wall. I repaired a broken dice box made out of walnut for my brother. And then I made my own dice box with a black and red stripes out of felt. After moving back to the USA from France, I built knot boards for my kids to learn knots in the car on the drive across the USA.\n                Climbing Wall In 2019 I built this seven foot high wall for my daughter to climb on from Birch and Douglas Fir. Two years later I built the crack climbing volume ( Bullet wood, Red Oak, and Padauk) and hand holds ( Big Leaf Maple). At three and a half we started climbing on basalt columns.\n             Decks, Floors, Fences and Garden Features Cedar deck. Later a Red Wood planter was added (circa 2015). Hickory engineered hardwood flooring. A metal and wood fence (2019).          \nDoors I love five panel shaker style doors. In 2019 I tried my hand at a pair of cabinet doors before I anticipate making the necessary doors for my home.      \nMusical instruments Two unfinished Ukuleles. (I also somewhere along the line repaired a Ukulele for a friend.)   \nKitchen My first wood shop project ever — the cutting board from 9th grade (1997). (Although I had a set of chisels in grade school that I made a boat out of\u0026hellip;) Somehow I managed to make two of these. The first one I put an edge on so that one could slide the cutting board under the thing to be cut. The second one I made with rounded edges. This is a picture of the one with rounded edges. In 2022 I started making cutting boards to sell. The first two to come out of the shop were walnut and spalted maple.  \nMore recent cutting boards In 2022 I made about 14 cutting boards to sell. I made a design pattern and then started to play around with it.

Here are my notes on how to do it.\nI follow the install directions here: http://www.xmlmind.com/xmleditor/_distrib/doc/help/installing_xxe.html\nGenerally, the instructions follow like those below for version 8:\n Make sure that the Java™ bin/ directory is referenced in the $PATH and, at the same time, check that the Java™ runtime in the $PATH has the right version:\n    A command like the following will show the java version number. UserName$ java -version java version \u0026ldquo;10.0.1\u0026rdquo; 2018-04-17 Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment 18.3 (build 10.0.1+10) Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM 18.3 (build 10.0.1+10, mixed mode)\nUnpack the XXE distribution inside any directory you want:\n\u0026gt; $ cd $ unzip xxe-pro-8_2_0.zip $ ls xxe-pro-8_2_0 addon/ bin/ demo/ doc/ ...   XXE is intended to be used directly from the xxe-pro-8_2_0/ directory. That is, you can start XXE by simply executing:\n $ xxe-pro-8_2_0/bin/xxe \u0026amp;  I can never remember what to do next. Here is the solution:\nOn my system xxe \u0026amp; is sym-linked to the version that I want to be primary. This is done in /usr/local/bin\nSo then there is a script in /usr/local/bin which points back to the application (I don\u0026rsquo;t really know as I didn\u0026rsquo;t write it), but the point is that the symlink needs to be adjusted and can be adjusted with a combination of these tips:\nFind out which version of xxe the item in local/bin is pointed at with the following command: ls -l xxe Then if you want to adjust the versions one needs to over write the existing symlink. Or create a new one. In my case I changed xxe to xxe7.\nNote Do not adjust ~/.bash_profile as that will only mess things up\n I did this once with export $PATH=/absolute/path/to/xxe/and then my machine couldn\u0026rsquo;t find /usr/local/bin any more.\n If one wants an xxe command then use that, but for me so that I don\u0026rsquo;t have to update the command all the time I use xxe7 for XMLMind version 7 and xxe8 and so forth.\nthen symlink like so: cd /usr/local/bin\n/usr/local/bin$ sudo ln -s /home/username/path/to/XMLMind/xxe-version-folder/bin/xxe /usr/local/bin/xxe8\n","date":1540906545,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1540906545,"objectID":"5495aa987b7a7ed5c0cc0a4d6e9259e8","permalink":"https://hughandbecky.us/Hugh-CV/post/xlingpaper-upgrade-on-linux/","publishdate":"2018-10-30T14:35:45+01:00","relpermalink":"/Hugh-CV/post/xlingpaper-upgrade-on-linux/","section":"post","summary":"Steps needed when uprading XLingPaper on Linux.","tags":["XLingPaper","Linux"],"title":"XLingPaper Upgrade on Linux","type":"post"},{"authors":["Hugh Paterson III"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1535673600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1535673600,"objectID":"191b30f4c1c3b0bc74b2f57921bf4e97","permalink":"https://hughandbecky.us/Hugh-CV/publication/2021-dan-annotated-bibliography/","publishdate":"2018-08-31T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/Hugh-CV/publication/2021-dan-annotated-bibliography/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["Bibliography","Eastern Dan"],"title":"Dan Annotated Bibliography","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Hugh Paterson III"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1533918622,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1533918622,"objectID":"59a3021eb79c4388c1f300c85e5b21a7","permalink":"https://hughandbecky.us/Hugh-CV/project/2018-dan-bibliography/","publishdate":"2018-08-10T09:30:22-07:00","relpermalink":"/Hugh-CV/project/2018-dan-bibliography/","section":"project","summary":"An essential resource for anyone doing research in Dan langauge speaking areas.","tags":["Dan","Bibliography","Library Science"],"title":"Dan Bibliography","type":"project"},{"authors":["Hugh Paterson III"],"categories":["Bibliography"],"content":"This is a short non-exhaustive bibliography of phonological descriptions of Philippine languages.\nCitations are kept in a GitHub gist.

In the past I have used a combination of EndNote and Papers2. A few years ago I wrote a review of EndNote X4 for Mac and I thought that I would go back and take a look at what I thought about that review and the new version of EndNote 8.\nKeep in mind that I have over 8,500 references in my EndNote file. My biggest complaints are:\n It is slow. There still is no keyboard short cut for importing a reference. The \u0026ldquo;detect duplicates\u0026rdquo; script does not allow one to exit successfully prior to completing all the items in your detected duplicate list. (Which for some might be very long, and cause the script to crash!) There is no mechanism in the collections area to browse by journal or book-series. When looking at a reference, there is no clear way to determine if it is in one of several collections (including in the check for duplicate script). There does not seem to be an export style for exporting to bibJSON. (I might be creating one soon). No auto suggest for missing citation metadata. For me, EndNote, when importing citations which contain a relative link to a PDF on my machine, does not actually import the PDF to an endnote managed folder. I want all my PDFs in one place. And if they are not in the EndNote managed folder I want a visual indication that they are outside the EndNote data folder.  These are my observations as I try and work with EndNote (and have over the last few months). For me, Papers2 (I haven\u0026rsquo;t bought Papers3) nailed the interaction around PDF management and citation management, from a User Experience perspective. Papers2 just didn\u0026rsquo;t have the custom fields necessary for me, So I was never able to completly rid myself of EndNote.\n","date":1523972145,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1523972145,"objectID":"cc9a0b87e9b91c9af5d62f735c019f16","permalink":"https://hughandbecky.us/Hugh-CV/post/endnote-x8-a-review/","publishdate":"2018-04-17T14:35:45+01:00","relpermalink":"/Hugh-CV/post/endnote-x8-a-review/","section":"post","summary":"A review of EndNote X8 as I look to compare it with other products on the market.","tags":["Endnote","Reference Managers","Library","OSX","PDF Management","Authorship Tools"],"title":"EndNote X8: A Review","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":["Research Note"],"content":"Introduction Digital language death is a real issue for many small and under-resourced languages. To use Kornai’s (2013) terms, the digital moribund state of languages is accelerated by the lack of intuitive and useful text input methods for many minority and under-resourced languages. Even if text input methods currently exist for a language, it is often the case that they are disruptive (rather than smooth) to the digital text production process, due to inadequately optimized keyboards. This disruption then serves as a barrier to creating vibrant digital communities using these under-resourced languages. What is observed is that users of under-resourced languages often choose to use another language in digital contexts rather than deal with the disruptions of awkward keyboard input requirements. This actually serves to accelerate and solidify the under-resourced language in its moribund “vitality” state. Optimized Keyboard Layouts are an academic pursuit in applied mathematics and computer science which intend to make keyboards intuitive and useful. Despite being language-related resources, keyboards and text input methods are rarely mentioned in the language development literature. Within the computer science literature Yin and Su (2011) situate the optimization of the keyboard in a context known as the general keyboard arrangement problem (GKAP). Their work is well respected, but does not take into account several issues common to the minority-language context, such as keyboards with deadkey interactions, graphemic complexities (such as diacritic usage), and embedded linguistic knowledge (such as tone patterns, or multi-graph functional units). For example, Bi et al. (2012) look at the efficiency of text input with the deadkey method for diacritics, and contrast that with a single keystroke for a “composed” character. They conclude that the deadkey method is more efficient, but they only run their tests on European languages with orthographies that have a diacritic to total character density of less than 4%. Commonly, European languages use diacritics to indicate vowel quality. In contrast, many languages use diacritics to show tone patterns. In preliminary counts of minority-languages in both Mexico and Nigeria, I have encountered diacritic densities of over 30%. This means the extra time and effort it takes to use deadkeys is much more significant in these languages. Paterson (2014) lays a foundation for the kinds of issues encountered by minority-languages typists, as an appeal to creators of resources for under-resourced languages to use design principles (Vitsœ 2012, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services 2018) in the creation of their language resource products. There, I argue that better design of text input solutions, which take into account linguistic knowledge about a language’s orthography, will increase the opportunities for digital vitality in an under-resourced language. It does not, however, present a methodology for assessing the disruptive nature of a text input solution, so we still lack a metric for comparing the relative ease of typing on any given keyboard layout for a given language. There currently does not exist a principled way to evaluate the utility or the application of User Experience principles (Garrett 2002) and design criteria to keyboard layouts. Researchers who have published on the keyboard optimization problem generally evaluate keyboard layouts on the basis of a composite “fitness score”. These scores only take into account the metrics of a single language - generally English - and only do it from an ergonomic perspective. As researchers in the field of language development, we are effectively blind when it comes to our ability to compare efficiency of two proposed keyboard layouts serving the same language,. A good framework does not exist for allowing researchers to ask the question: does QWERTY serve English users equally as well as AWERZY does to French users? - or any number of keyboards and their corresponding minority-languages. Language development practitioners and linguists working in many different languages have created many keyboard layouts. However, linguists have not adequately accounted for the linguistic dissonance between the psycholinguistic and phonemic realities of a spoken language and a speaker’s experience in typing that language. This has created a gap between the “possible to write/type” orthography and the “easy to write/type” orthography. The general keyboard arrangement problem (GKAP) has been situated as a time over distance problem, i.e., speed. The assumption has been that if fingers travel a smaller distance, then faster typing should be the result. A secondary argument to increase speed has been to reduce effort. The assessment of effort has been tied to Fitts’ law (MacKenzie 1992) for measurements of physical effort. However, mental effort or user-perceived effort remains unassessed. By visualizing keystrokes, we can identify the locus of impact in any given language. In language development work it is often the case that low-usage keys in an English-QWERTY layout are replaced with “new characters” to form keyboard layouts. The consequence has been the placement of frequently used keys under weak fingers, as demonstrated by the Meꞌphaa keyboard layout below. Notice the high frequency red(dish) areas and the lower frequency blue areas. These red areas would normally be struck with the pinky fingers.\nFigure 1: Meꞌphaa Keyboard\n\nSpanish, distributes the same amount of information across multiple fingers as shown in Figure 2 below. According to current keyboard layout theory even the Spanish keyboard is heavy on the weaker fingers of the left hand, but at least is better than the Meꞌphaa layout.\nFigure 2: Spanish Keyboard\n\nContrasting these two languages allows us to visualize how they are different with respect to the actions of the pinky finger. It also demonstrates how the attempt to ‘conserve QWERTY’ impacts typing in minority languages. Notice how the Meꞌphaa keyboard layout replaces the Spanish〈ç〉character with a tone diacritic key. Also note that these tone diacritics are very frequent in Meꞌphaa, and create a typing imbalance. Additionally, the Meꞌphaa Saltillo〈ꞌ〉 key is also on the right side with heavy use, further contributing to the typing imbalance. These diagrams demonstrate the part of the keyboard layout analysis that can be computed using existing GKAP methods. What linguists bring to the discussion is an awareness of linguistic components. Orthographies are not just Unicode characters, but are functional units. The encoding of a functional unit can change from orthography to orthography. This is missed by many GKAP researchers. One needs to look beyond Unicode characters and toward ratios of keystrokes to functional units. One way that linguists look at functional units differently than “pure technologists” is in the area of tone. Snider (2014) and Hyman (2014) both argue for an analysis of tone that looks at patterns across the domain of tonal attachment (usually the word or morpheme) rather than the more structuralist and segmental view of “letter plus pitch” which is the encoding method that Unicode follows. The difference in behavior becomes clearer when we contrast reading diacritic tone marks with a language which does not use diacritical marking. Imagine the following example represents the same sentence in two different languages.\nA tone pattern analysis (following Snider and Hyman) would suggest that we should understand the tonally marked sentence to represent the segmental and the suprasegmental tiers separately, something like the following:\nIt is observed, anecdotally, that many writers of tone languages parse the writing task into two activities, one for each tier of information. Usually the segmental tier is completed first and then the suprasegmental tier.\nThis makes the writing activity much like handwriting in the United States where we say: “don’t forget to dot your \u0026lsquo;i\u0026rsquo;s and cross your ‘t’s. The writer first completes the segmental tier and then comes back across with a second pass and completes dots the ‘i’s and crosses the ‘t’s. However, the nature of typing, and Unicode’s structural nature, requires typists to complete the text production task linearly by codepoint. This creates dissonance from what many language users find “natural”, requiring them to frequently alternate their attention between the two tiers, as shown by the up and down movement in the following diagram.\nThe goal of this thesis will be to develop and apply metrics to keyboard layouts so that their ease of use can be analysed and compared. Some optimised keyboards in a few sample languages will also be presented. Preliminary testing of these ideas has been done on English [eng], Spanish [spa], Me’phaa [tcf], and Chinantec [cso], as mentioned in Paterson (2014) and work done with Nigerian languages in Paterson (2015) covering Ezza [eza], Bekwarra [bkv], Cishingini [asg], Okphela [atg], and Igbo [ibo]. However, for this thesis I anticipate focusing on the three following languages: Navajo [nav], Kabiyè [kbp], and Eastern Dan [dnj], and especially the latter two, as they are related languages with very different design decisions in their orthographies, and both have very clear analysis of their tonal systems. This should allow observations about the typing process in one language to be contrasted with another related language. Further, there is a reasonable amount of text to work with in each language. Ultimately the final languages used will depend on the accessibility of corpora content in those languages.\nThis thesis will add to the current GKAP discussion by proposing a theoretical framework and a two-metric algorithm that can be applied to any keyboard layout for any language using a Latin based script. The first metric will account for disruption in the phoneme (or functional unit) stream while engaged in typing, and the second will account for non-character-producing keystrokes, thus addressing the major problem areas outlined above. These metrics will then be combined with a haptic fitness score to produce a fitness score which accounts for linguistic knowledge. This thesis will contribute to the ongoing language development discussion by providing a quality assessment metric for the evaluation of a very important language-based digital product.\nResearch questions The problem to be addressed can be expressed informally like this:\n “We have these keyboards layouts in all these languages, but they are not being used, and in general people find it easier to type in languages other than their mother tongue. To what extent are our keyboards disruptive and thereby impeding language use in digital contexts? Can we measure the disruption?”\n More precisely, the following sub-questions can be addressed in the course of this investigation:\n What percentage of extra work is required to type minority-language texts?\n Here, the “extra work” measurement might be measured in terms of the distance traveled, the time required to travel that distance, and the number of keystrokes, as compared between a language of wider communication and a minority language.\n In a given language, what is the added unnecessary distance when typing text?\n  What are some common traits of excessive use/difficulty in text input keyboards for minority languages, and how can those commonalities of “pain”, be generalized for designers to avoid?\n  Do we account for functional units (e.g. phonemes and tones) independent from character optimization? That is, does optimizing for character input also optimize for functional unit input?\n  Can we predict that with tone languages we will exceed the Hick’s law minimum, whereas in non-tonal languages we can stay under Hick’s law?\n Hick’s law (Hick 1952) is a reference to how performance decreases as temporary memory functions increase, i.e., when we need to hold information in our temporary memory. This can be calculated on the basis of how many characters does one need to type in between the elements of a diacritic digraph.\n How can we measure the dissonance factor for a particular keyboard layout? That is, how much dissonance does a keyboard layout solution induce?\n Dissonance is the cognitively difficult, or non-prefered choices that we must make to achieve the desired results. Dissonance is increased by those things which militate against fluidity, and includes factors such as non-correspondence between keystrokes and functional units, the elements of a digraph, and multiple keystrokes per orthographic character.\nProject specifics To perform the supporting analysis I will use existing texts to form a “corpus of keystrokes” and a “corpus of functional units”. I use the corpus of texts in conjunction with the existing keyboard layout to suggest what the “keystrokes required” would have been to produce a text (assuming 100% accuracy). Given that I am working with corpora, rather than original production data, I will not have actual time-over-distance measurements. I will rather, as is the norm for working with corpora in this context, infer the time to completion for each keystroke based on previously published experiments which show the time it takes to move a finger from one key to another. Then I will look at the functional units and measure (1) how many keystrokes to functional units are required, and (2) how much dissonance is created in the process of typing. Existing keyboard layouts for the languages of the texts in question will be analysed, and scored. Finally, improved keyboard layouts with better scores will be suggested.\nReferences  Xi Bi, BA Smith, S Zhai (2012) Multilingual touchscreen keyboard design and optimization.

I had the duty of removing the snake. While I recommend treating all snakes in Africa as venomous I had no idea if this one was or was not. I treated it like I do most snakes. Look for a makeshift snake hook (snake stick) and pin the snake for safe handling and treat it as if it were venomous.\nThe snake was about 7 inches long and about as thick as my pink y finger 3/4 – 1 cm. It had a white striped coloring going from side to side but was mostly black/gray. The fangs were fairly widely set and its head was not triangular like a viper.     \nI took pictures but it is hard to be camera man and snake handler at the same time. After catching it, I then threw the snake over the compound wall into a field. I showed the pictures around and asked what kind of snake it was, and most people said, \u0026ldquo;cobra\u0026rdquo;. While I want to believe them it is easy to imagine that \u0026ldquo;cobra\u0026rdquo; is a generalizable term (choosing an iconic snake, because who hasn\u0026rsquo;t hear of a King Cobra?) for \u0026ldquo;dangerous\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;venomous\u0026rdquo;. My perception is that most people in Nigeria believe that all snakes are deadly (along with other interesting beliefs about snakes (Citation: Hambly,\u0026#32; 1929) Hambly,\u0026#32; W. \u0026#32; (1929). \u0026#32;The Serpent in African Belief and Custom.

In fact just within the last two years a child at the local boarding school managed by the college hosting us had been bitten and died from a snake bite, a sad but acknowledge reality in the academic literature (Citation: Nduagubam et al.,\u0026#32; 2020) Nduagubam,\u0026#32; O.,\u0026#32; Chime,\u0026#32; O.,\u0026#32; Ndu,\u0026#32; I.,\u0026#32; Bisi-Onyemaechi,\u0026#32; A.,\u0026#32; Eke,\u0026#32; C.,\u0026#32; Amadi,\u0026#32; O.\u0026#32;\u0026amp;\u0026#32;Igbokwe,\u0026#32; O. \u0026#32; (2020). \u0026#32;Snakebite in children in Nigeria: A comparison of the first aid treatment measures with the world health organization\u0026rsquo;s guidelines for management of snakebite in Africa.

Within this part of Nigeria there is a black necked cobra (Naja nigricollis) which is a spitting cobra1. The markings mostly did not match that description so I further discounted the cobra claims. And some suggested that the banded nature on the snake I found was due to it being juvenile and that it would grow to become a cobra.\nI have tried to identify the species but have not had any success. Field guides for West Africa (when they exist) are mostly without detailed pictures for each species. I have yet to find a Nigeria specific field guide for any area of biology or zoology. On hand we had several guides which were either from the 1960s or were reprints (Citation: Cansdale,\u0026#32; 1955) Cansdale,\u0026#32; G.\u0026#32; (1955). \u0026#32;Reptiles of West Africa. \u0026#32; Penguin Books.  and (Citation: Cansdale,\u0026#32; 1961) Cansdale,\u0026#32; G.\u0026#32; (1961). \u0026#32;West African snakes. \u0026#32; Longman.  . After my time in Tungan Magajiya I went back to Jos where I met with Roger Blench and he lent me (for a few hours) a copy of Atlas des reptiles du Cameroun (Citation: Chirio et al.,\u0026#32; 2007) Chirio,\u0026#32; L.\u0026#32;\u0026amp;\u0026#32;LeBreton,\u0026#32; M.\u0026#32; (2007). \u0026#32;Atlas des reptiles du Cameroun. \u0026#32; Publications scientifiques du Muséum national d\u0026#39;Histoire naturelle : IRD.\u0026#32;Retrieved from\u0026#32; https://www.nhbs.com/atlas-des-reptiles-du-cameroun-atlas-of-reptiles-of-cameroon-book  , which although not about Nigeria per se does contain some species which do overlap with Cameroon. However, this book offered no satisfying confirmations.\n A return to the Cobra hypothesis.  In 2021 I returned to the cobra hypothesis. I noticed that there is a Zebra snake, a spitting cobra in Namibia (which wikipedia suggests has been considered to be a sub-species of the black necked cobra). While I was in Nigeria when I encountered my snake, maybe the range is undocumented? The best YouTube video of a Zebra Cobra is below.\n  However, even if the snake I encountered in Nigeria was not the same species of cobra ( as there are several) it might have been a cobra.\nI found a photograph on Flickr of a juvenile King Cobra with stripes like the snake I found. The stripes, the color change in the mouth and under-head area, and the general head shape all fit the cobra hypothesis.\n  Juvenile King Cobra at Medtoxin Laboratories, Deland, FL.

Snake bite literature There is a lot of discussion (relatively) in literature about snake bites and treatment in Nigeria. My experience would tell me not to anticipate anyone having anti-venom at \u0026ldquo;medical\u0026rdquo; facilities. (Tungan Magajiya is between an eleven and twelve hour drive from Jos.)

The ones I know about are listed in the references section but are not called out here in this section. They are mostly older and out of date with current publishing practices.\nPlants While I am sure there have been more recent publications (or at lease I would hope so), the following resources are the once I am aware of for plant (mostly tree and flowers) identification in the Northwest Nigeria region: (Citation: Lely,\u0026#32; 1925) Lely,\u0026#32; H.\u0026#32; (1925). \u0026#32;The useful trees of northern Nigeria. \u0026#32; Crown agents for the colonies.\u0026#32;Retrieved from\u0026#32; https://hdl.handle.net/2027/umn.31951p00775127b  , (Citation: Morton et al.,\u0026#32; 1961) Morton,\u0026#32; J.\u0026#32;\u0026amp;\u0026#32;Loxton,\u0026#32; I.\u0026#32; (1961). \u0026#32;West African lilies and orchids.   , (Citation: Gledhill,\u0026#32; 1977) Gledhill,\u0026#32; D.\u0026#32; (1977). \u0026#32;West African trees. \u0026#32; Longman.  , (Citation: Segerbaeck,\u0026#32; 1983) Segerbaeck,\u0026#32; L.\u0026#32; (1983). \u0026#32;Orchids of Nigeria: Description of 104 species. \u0026#32; Balkema.  , (Citation: Lawson,\u0026#32; 1985) Lawson,\u0026#32; G.\u0026#32; (1985). \u0026#32;Plant life in West Africa (2nd ed). \u0026#32; Ghana Universities Press.  , (Citation: Oliver-Bever,\u0026#32; 1986) Oliver-Bever,\u0026#32; B.\u0026#32; (1986). \u0026#32;Medicinal plants in tropical West Africa. \u0026#32; Cambridge University Press. https://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511753114  , (Citation: Steentoft,\u0026#32; 1988) Steentoft,\u0026#32; M.\u0026#32; (1988). \u0026#32;Flowering plants in West Africa. \u0026#32; Cambridge University Press.  , and (Citation: Hawthorne et al.,\u0026#32; 2006) Hawthorne,\u0026#32; W.\u0026#32;\u0026amp;\u0026#32;Jongkind,\u0026#32; C.\u0026#32; (2006). \u0026#32;Woody plants of Western African forests: A guide to the forest trees, shrubs and lianes from Senegal to Ghana. \u0026#32; Kew Pub.  .\nBirds Someday I would love to collaborate with a bird enthusiast (bird watcher) to identify, photograph and collect stories about birds in the minority languages of norther Nigeria. It would be a fun project. Most of the bird guides I am aware of are older publications including: (Citation: Bannerman,\u0026#32; 1951) Bannerman,\u0026#32; D.\u0026#32; (1951). \u0026#32;The birds of tropical West Africa, with special reference to those of the Gambia, Sierra Leone, the Gold Coast and Nigeria. \u0026#32; Crown Agents for the Colonies, published under the authority of the Secretary of State for the Colonies.  , (Citation: Elgood,\u0026#32; 1976,\u0026#32;p.\u0026nbsp;serle_field_1977) Elgood,\u0026#32; J.\u0026#32; (1976). \u0026#32;Birds of the West African town and garden. \u0026#32; Longman.  , (Citation: Nason et al.,\u0026#32; 1992) Nason,\u0026#32; A.\u0026#32;\u0026amp;\u0026#32;\u0026#32; (1992). \u0026#32;Discovering birds: An introduction to the birds of Nigeria. \u0026#32; Pisces Publications.  , and (Citation: Elgood,\u0026#32; 1995) Elgood,\u0026#32; J.\u0026#32; (1995). \u0026#32;The birds of Nigeria: An annotated check-list. \u0026#32; British Ornithologists\u0026#39; Union.  . However, several newer publications have been printed (Citation: Borrow et al.,\u0026#32; 2001) Borrow,\u0026#32; N.\u0026#32;\u0026amp;\u0026#32;Demey,\u0026#32; R.\u0026#32; (2001). \u0026#32;A guide to the birds of western Africa. \u0026#32; Princeton University Press.  , (Citation: Borrow et al.,\u0026#32; 2004) Borrow,\u0026#32; N.\u0026#32;\u0026amp;\u0026#32;Demey,\u0026#32; R.\u0026#32; (2004). \u0026#32;Birds of Western Africa. \u0026#32; Princeton University Press.  , and (Citation: Borrow,\u0026#32; 2014) Borrow,\u0026#32; N.\u0026#32; (2014). \u0026#32;Birds of western Africa (2). \u0026#32; Bloomsbury Publishing.  . The latest one claiming to be nearly comprehensive.\nSpecies names in minority languages Roger Blench has the most comprehensive lists of plant and animal names across the minority languages of northern Nigeria. As I understand it, he is working on publishing some of these to mobile apps. Some of these lists (usually by language) may be available from his website.\nOnline The state of online resources has also increased. I have felt that the quality of wikipedia is low and this has pushed me to discover other biodiversity based information sources. In general, online resources are not available from Tungan Magajiya due to infrastructure and internet connectivity issues. For a large variety of plant and animal species identification tasks I have found inaturalist.org helpful as well as gbif.org. (Both links are to \u0026ldquo;Nigeria wide\u0026rdquo; searches on the respective websites.)\nPublishers I find that the materials at nhbs.com are generally of a good quality (in terms of depth). But there are lots of other publishers. Often one will find publications at the academic societies for the study of the family of species or at regionally focused conservation societies.\nLanguage of Scholarship I would like to point out that English is not the only language of scholarship — especially on matters of Africa. There are considerable resources also published in French, German, and Russian. (I have pointed to (Citation: Chirio et al.,\u0026#32; 2007) Chirio,\u0026#32; L.\u0026#32;\u0026amp;\u0026#32;LeBreton,\u0026#32; M.\u0026#32; (2007). \u0026#32;Atlas des reptiles du Cameroun. \u0026#32; Publications scientifiques du Muséum national d\u0026#39;Histoire naturelle : IRD.\u0026#32;Retrieved from\u0026#32; https://www.nhbs.com/atlas-des-reptiles-du-cameroun-atlas-of-reptiles-of-cameroon-book  [French] and (Citation: Rödel,\u0026#32; 1996) Rödel,\u0026#32; M.\u0026#32; (1996). \u0026#32;Amphibien der westafrikanischen savanne. \u0026#32; Edition Chimaira.\u0026#32;Retrieved from\u0026#32; https://www.nhbs.com/amphibien-der-westafrikanischen-savanne-volume-1-book  [German] in this post.) Arabic no-doubt also has considerable resources due to its long history of use in north and east Africa. Spanish, Italian, and Portuguese scholarship should not be overlooked. I am just not personally versed in the scope of treatment on African matters in languages other than English, German, and French.\nReferences   Ackery,\u0026#32; Smith\u0026#32;\u0026amp;\u0026#32;Vane-Wright (1995)  Ackery,\u0026#32; P.,\u0026#32; Smith,\u0026#32; C.\u0026#32;\u0026amp;\u0026#32;Vane-Wright,\u0026#32; R.\u0026#32; (1995). \u0026#32;Carcasson\u0026rsquo;s African butterflies: an annotated catalogue of the Papilionoidea and Hesperioidea of the Afrotropical region. \u0026#32; CSIRO Publishing.\u0026#32;Retrieved from\u0026#32; https://rbdigital.rbdigital.com    Ameen,\u0026#32; Salihu,\u0026#32; Mbaoji,\u0026#32; Anoruo-Dibia\u0026#32;\u0026amp;\u0026#32;Adedokun (2015)  Ameen,\u0026#32; S.,\u0026#32; Salihu,\u0026#32; T.,\u0026#32; Mbaoji,\u0026#32; C.,\u0026#32; Anoruo-Dibia,\u0026#32; C.\u0026#32;\u0026amp;\u0026#32;Adedokun,\u0026#32; R. \u0026#32; (2015). \u0026#32;Medicinal plants used to treat Snake bite by Fulani Herdsmen in Taraba State, Nigeria.

One important context to make clear is the distinction between the HTML and visual presentation/content layer of a website, the code of a website, and any downloadable objects in a website such as PDFs. Today I was looking at the Rapid Words website. Rapid Words is an SIL product and methodology which facilitates a multi-party conversation to quickly discover many words in a language. SIL developed a specific website to promote this methodology and its associated downloadable content. As I review the website, I am wondering several things about the licenses advertised on the RapidWords site. The web-page I am looking at: http://www.rapidwords.net/resources/files/rwc-questionnaire Screen shots are presented here for ease of access (and permanence).\n  Bottom of Page Credit: rapidwords.net (SIL International)       Bottom of Page Credit: rapidwords.net (SIL International)     In the footer, I see a copyright statement and then a CC-BY-SA license. Many websites who choose to put copyright and license material in the footer are really only referencing the Theme files of their web-page, or the immediately on-screen content. This is very common for open-source themes for WordPress, Drupal, and Joomla. It is unclear to me if this is the case on the RapidWords website. Or is the footer referring to the entire content of the website inclusive of the downloadable content? If it is referring to the theme files, then they ought to be licensed as code not as a creative work according to the Creative Commons Foundation. (The Creative Commons Foundation recommends not using Creative Commons Licenses for code base projects and points to other more appropriate licenses.)\nWhen I go the content of the web-page link above (see screens shot), there is a CC license field in the middel of the page. This field is empty and in lieu of a license, I find a copyright statement saying all \u0026ldquo;rights are reserved\u0026rdquo;. So which is it? CC-BY-SA or All rights reserved?\n  Close-up of screen content Credit: rapidwords.net (SIL International)     Then when I download the PDF of the content via the PDF button provided the content of the PDF only contains the copyright statement not the CC-BY-SA statement. Further adding confusion because the website is offering a PDF to me but then saying that the PDF is \u0026ldquo;all rights reserved\u0026rdquo;.\nAlso, when one downloads the resources under the resource section the resources do not have a license statement in them (I would have expected a copyright and a license statement in the footer of each printable page in the downloaded document). Because there is a footer on the web-page with a CC license, is the website user to assume that these download able resources are CC-BY-SA?\nOrganizations can avoid sending mixed messages to their constituency by clearly marking who is the copyright holder, on websites and the content those websites contain. Organizational policies related to web-publishing should include editorial checks for these sorts of issues.\n","date":1493068478,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1493068478,"objectID":"d3f0b9e01828bf69d975606194cbacd8","permalink":"https://hughandbecky.us/Hugh-CV/post/website-license-vs-content-license/","publishdate":"2017-04-24T14:14:38-07:00","relpermalink":"/Hugh-CV/post/website-license-vs-content-license/","section":"post","summary":"Various understandings of metadata profile for the Open Language Archive Community exist in the literature.

I wonder, if the future of survey is no-longer looking at where indigenous people are living and what language variations they may have, but rather looking at where these people are going. Consider just the migrants from Nigeria according to lucify.com 89,032 Nigerians have immigrated towards Europe in the last 4 years. That is a lot of people. Language Survey has had a business function to generate information about ethnolinguistic communities in preperation for various kinds of language development activites. Other busiensses have customer serveys and market surveys. Language Survey serves a similar function. Perhaps the following questions ought to be asked:\n Where do those people come from? What languages do they speak? What linguistic load is being put on European governmental services? What could SIL offer to these governmental agencies? How could various social organizations benefit from SIL\u0026rsquo;s often long standing work in the regions that these immigrants are coming from?    European migration destinations from Nigeria. Credit: lucify.com     Comments  Peter Brassington on February 20, 2017 at 5:16 am said:\n 89,000 sounds a lot but it’s a pretty small percentage of the population of Nigeria. Maybe we need to continue to look at where most speakers of a language live but also look at where people are relocating both within and outside their country of origin.

I was able to help facilitate service design conversations both inside and outside the department. We used the business model canvas to capture business activities. We were then able to use the Value Proposition Canvas to talk about how we might add value to our customers by addressing their pain points. We wanted to know what a more valued service might look like to our customers.\nWe also introduced a service maturity model to help business plan owners look at the maturity of their business model and service and pursue growth opportunities.\nOften in business modeling final solutions pencil out in financial numbers. With NGO work we have multiple non-traditional applications of the Business Model Canvas. For instance:\n We have customers who are not the payees. We have social impact goals compete with financial goals. We have income streams which are not directly tied to output services rendered or products produced.

It is about breaking down communication silos and working across corporate structures to create a unified workforce. I have the ongoing privilege of consulting with department heads and team leaders on interdepartmental communication and audience engagement strategies. Often this involves creative uses of technology and creating data management plans and publishing work flows. At SIL International we use MailChimp, and Confluence to meet these communication needs.\nSIL International is over 80 years old. A majority of its staff are Baby-boomers. Currently work flows, even digital ones, usually mirror processes set up in paper based work enviroments. SIL International as an organization has organizational units of various sizes in various locations of the world. Many of these units are also distributed teams. In the broader business world the battle for effective team communications is generally characterized as a battle between looking in the inbox and using the browser for information, collaboration, and connectivity. Tools like #slack, and management decisions to look for more effective team communications platforms have tried to push email our of use. In SIL International the very diverse nature of the workforce presents challenges to those with low-bandwidth connectivity.\nWe use a two prong communications approach. Email and corporate blog use. For Email we use Mailchimp. For the corporate blog we use Confluence Wiki.\nSIL International deployed Confluence company wide in 2008 as a white board for people in the organization to use within their organizational unit. By 2011 the wiki had evolved into a platform for departmental websites and had supplanted official information repositories for official documentation. This has made the platform invaluable for interdepartmental communications.\nIn 2015 various organizational units within SIL International started to independently use Mailchimp.\nDue to the highly transitional nature of SIL International staff, it is often the case that SIL staff do not have the knowledge base needed to leverage the capacities of these two systems. My role is often to demonstrate features relevant to business goals.\nI have engaged with:\n SIL International Language and Culture Archive SIL International Language Program Training SIL International Language Program Services SIL International External Communications SIL Intellectual Property Team  ","date":1461715200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1461715200,"objectID":"0e620e9898058323beca1b11cded2f8e","permalink":"https://hughandbecky.us/Hugh-CV/project/2017-sil-ils-communications/","publishdate":"2016-04-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/Hugh-CV/project/2017-sil-ils-communications/","section":"project","summary":"Strategy and technology consultation with SIL staff to develop interdepartmental communications strategy.","tags":["Architecture","Business","SIL-International"],"title":"SIL Communication Strategy Consulting","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Previous work:\nThis project follows and builds upon the project where keyboard layouts for Meꞌphaa and Sochiapam Chinantec were produced. This project uses data from Meꞌphaa and Sochiapam Chinantec but purposely extends the scope of the analysis to include Latin and Cyrillic script languages, particularly focusing on those with diacritics which express tone.\nGoals:\nThe goal of this project is to bring \u0026lsquo;natural\u0026rsquo;, intuitive, and easy to use typing experiences in the form of keyboard layout designs to minority language users. These language users often do not type in their own languages, but rather experience technology through languages other than their first language. This is in part because of the perception that their language is complex or not easy to type, which is often not an invalid observation. However, with these languages which have different and sometimes more characters than English, what does a good layout look like? The objectives of this project are threefold:\n To establish a consistent method to evaluate the appropriateness of a keyboard layout for a specific language situation given a specific text sample. This needs to include deadkeys and alt states.   This needs to account for monolingual situations This needs to account for multi-lingual situations where each language has its own keyboard This needs to account for multi-lingual situations where only a single keyboard is used  Provide a best fit solution recommendation when provided the following:   A corpus of text encoded in UTF-16 or UTF-8 in any language A user selected choice between a physical keyboard layout of ANSI, ISO, or JIS The application providing the best fit solution needs to be able to suggest a better layout, inclusive of alt states and deadkey options.  Assess and analyze real user feedback. That is, measure the impacts of keyboards on users.

In many socio-cultural contexts the ability to input digital text undergirds sustainable social practice of literacy. Simons and Lewis (2010) describe the social practice of literacy (EGIDS levels four and five) as a sign of a healthy language. A text input device which does not intuitively work for language users can be seen as discriminating and be a reason for speakers to choose to not use their language in digital mediums (Trosterud 2012), adversely affecting language development efforts. The challenge then is to provide a digital text input method (1) that works well for the orthography of any given language and (2) that users also find intuitive. \n\n Paterson (2015) presents a framework to evaluate or rank the complexity of the text input task on a per orthography bases. We apply this framework and present the results from five Nigerian languages: Ezza [[eza](https://iso639-3.sil.org/code/eza)], Bekwarra [[bkv](https://iso639-3.sil.org/code/bkv)], Cishingini [[asg](https://iso639-3.sil.org/code/asg)], Okphela [[atg](https://iso639-3.sil.org/code/atg)], and Igbo [[ibo](https://iso639-3.sil.org/code/ibo)]. We discuss relevant user experience (UX) considerations for keyboard layouts and unique actions undertaken in the communicative act of ‘encoding’ language (typing). We follow previous work which focuses on majority language text input methods (Bellman \u0026 MacKenzie 1998, Castellucci \u0026 MacKenzie 2013, MacKenzie 1992, 2002, 2007, MacKenzie \u0026 Soukoreff 2002, Soukoreff \u0026 MacKenzie 2001, 2003a, b) and apply considerations for minority language orthographies - especially those orthographies which overtly mark tone and other distinctions via diacritics. \n\n Many minority language users often find it difficult to type in their languages because of the way that orthography specific and language specific characters are accessed through existing keyboard layouts (Paterson 2014). The keyboard layout is an essential component in text input both on mobile touch screen and traditional devices. Barriers to efficiently using text in digital mediums has a wide impact on language vitality, by affecting the way that language users perceive their language’s viability in the 21st century context. Minority language users acknowledge the difficulty of text input in their languages (Esizmetor 2009: 13, Zheltov 2005). \n\n Perceptions about the need for text based digital communication devices has sufficiently challenged language communities leading some to change their orthographies (South Pacific - Boerger 2007: 133; Central Asia - Cooper 2005: 149, 160; Americas - Jany 2010:235-6). However, it is unclear if the issue is the text input process or some other interaction between users and an orthography. The African context is not immune to these challenges (Bailey 2007). Africa is probably more sensitive to text input difficulties than other geographical regions like the South Pacific because many Roman Script African orthographies overtly mark tone and other distinctions via diacritics.","tags":["Text Input"],"title":"African Languages: Assessing the text input difficulty","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Hugh Paterson III"],"categories":["Research Note"],"content":"Working in services design and web-data handeling, I see a lot of different policies and data handling practices.

Founders of new services focusing on linguistics, language, and cultural heritage oriented data interactions and transactions may be aware of data concerns from a legal framework (within a certain country) point of view, but, they may be unfamiliar with data concerns as viewed by the community. While the concerns of minority language using communities may not be well known to businesses familiar with data handling procedures, these practices are often known to linguists working in and with communities of minority language users. An additional layer of complexity is that in many cases service users in minority language communities, may not understand the possible data protection rights available to them, or why they may need additional rights in digital contexts.\nhttps://github.com/HughP/Linguistics-Services-Policies\n","date":1425648945,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1425648945,"objectID":"a6f1496da29648eeb146bc4e2b75eee6","permalink":"https://hughandbecky.us/Hugh-CV/post/linguistic-service-policies/","publishdate":"2015-03-06T14:35:45+01:00","relpermalink":"/Hugh-CV/post/linguistic-service-policies/","section":"post","summary":"Working in services design and web-data handeling, I see a lot of different policies and data handling practices.

Woodbury (2003) suggests that lexical database resources should become part of the preserved documentary evidence - regardless of decisions to classify lexical datasets (which are often the foundational resources for dictionaries) as ‘language description’ or ‘language documentation’ materials. Language artifacts stewarded by archives are increasingly important in linguistic analysis, in peer review, and to minority language communities. This is in large part due to the impact of language documentation (Himmelmann 1998) on the linguistic sciences. However, as scientists and producers of language material artifacts, do archiving requirements come to us as linguists begrudgingly or do we embrace them? Paterson \u0026 Nordmoe (2013) suggests that among SIL staff there exist over 1 million unarchived minority language related artifacts including a substantial number of lexical databases. Lexical databases are complex resources potentially representing thousands of work-hours in data edits and curating and are valued by a wide variety of users including those who are interested in language revitalization and language descriptions.  \n\n Given the claim by Paterson and Nordmoe that such a large quantity of resources are in danger of being lost, contributing to the “erosion of the base” within linguistics; I think an important question should be asked: _is the volume of unarchived and endangered resources a localized behavioral attribute within a particular social network or is it a linguistics wide phenomenon?_ \n\n In this presentation results are presented which test the hypothesis that quantitative rates of archiving lexical dataset resources are homogeneous between SIL linguists (84 respondents) and non-SIL linguists (78 respondents). Further, an analysis of questionnaire results sent to linguists who self-identified as FLEx or Toolbox users is presented. The results suggest that there is homogeneity between the two groups of respondents with respect to archiving practices and that archiving rates are low compared to the number of lexical databases created. The low ratio of archived lexical databases to unarchived lexical databases has the potential to impact the current and future capacity of linguists, especially where lexical database resources concern endangered languages.","tags":["Lexicography","Archive"],"title":"Lexical Dataset Archiving: An Assessment of Practice","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Hugh Paterson III"],"categories":null,"content":"Citable as:\nHugh J.

The aims of the curriculum were identified so as to be consistent with the aims of the Nigerian education system and in particular with the recently expressed aims of the Nigerian social studies curriculum which is intended to foster inter- and cross-ethnic communication and understanding and national identity in a country which contains more than 250 ethnic groups. A consideration of appropriate curriculum content led to the identification of five basic concepts in ethnomusicology and five concepts basic to social studies. The integration of these concepts into a unified curriculum was made through an Identity Approach which permitted the identification of relevant cognitive, affective and skill objectives and indicated appropriate learning processes. Three curriculum units were developed in detail and field tested in upper elementary classes in two elementary schools in southeastern Nigeria. This field testing—the classroom phase of the curriculum development— involved 120 students, ten teachers and the administrators of the schools. The staff were given instruction in the curriculum materials and the Identity Approach following which the students were engaged in twenty-four sessions and covered the three units which had been developed. The results of the classroom phase were studied from students\u0026rsquo;, teachers\u0026rsquo; and administrators\u0026rsquo; opinions and recommendations and their responses to four opinionaires. All responses indicated a high degree of student interest in the project and evidence of an increase in inter-and cross-ethnic understanding and respect. Teachers found the project to have contributed to their professional development and both teachers and administrators reported community interest and involvement. Problems identified by the staff and administrators related to inadequate funds and provision of materials or equipment. Administrators also noted the need for involvement by the Ministry of Education if widespread implementation were to be contemplated.\nJournals These are some journals which have or have have had relevant Ethnomusicology discussions.\n  Journal of the Musical Arts in Africa Journal of Popular Music Studies  Journal of Religion in Africa American Ethnologist  Studies in World Christianity Musicology Mission Frontiers The Journal of Pan African Studies Ethnomusicology Review  Ethnomusicology Pacific Review of Ethnomusicology  Analytical Approaches to World Music  Books  Waterman, Christopher Alan. 1990.

When we get beyond that level of discussion, there are some real issues and methods to building websites that people are proud to own, and proud to use.\nGoogle\u0026rsquo;s search page makes them lots of money and people use it all the time. It even won the popular search war against Yahoo! Facebook has a website that millions of people use every day. At some point a well designed website stops being a website in the minds of users and becomes a place where they work, hangout, arrange meetings, etc. When users stop realizing they are on a website, that is when I feel we have moved into a place in design where we are close to perfect for that situation.\nBetween 2010 and 2016 I worked with a team to bring modern features via Drupal 7 to the flagship website of SIL International. But I have also worked on WordPress sites (not for SIL) since 2005. And I consulted on a variety of other SIL web projects (some of them on WordPress).\nMy work with SIL started with a report that they were not using a print.css file on the SIL Bibliography in 2006 and were wasting a lot of ink when people were printing pages. I think this was corrected by 2009. This was typical for the pace of technical innovative change. SIL is a very corporate feature focused development environment.\nWithin User Experience studies, there is at least two ways to apply the term (UX): The design of experiences that a corporation wants their customers to engage in, and the way that people take an object (product) and decide to use it. Both are important, but how a company approaches either of these facets and how they relate that approach back to their other business goals scopes the relevance of User Experience Design within the organization.\nSuccessful interactions depend on both points of view and the metrics of success.\nSIL.org is an interesting use case in UX design for at least 5 reasons:\n  SIL has several major areas of very public interactions which it engages with to various degrees in various parts of the world — but the Internet is flat.\n Advocacy with public policy making bodies regarding the needs of minority language speakers. Publishing and sales of professional resources and materials. Bible translation. Educational programs (both formal and workshop style) in linguistics and language development. Mother tongue Multi-lingual educational programs. Minority language literacy (both integrated with national educational programs, and community sponsored programs, for children and adults). NGOs and development agencies. Innovative computer technology development related to non-English typesetting and computing. Innovative creative access power solutions (like solar). Sustainable logistical support for difficult to access project locations (usually via air).    SIL has historically had a very fractured internal identity, and a very decentralized governance, which has not required a high degree of uniformity throughout the organization. Digital infrastructure projects stress these social norms.\n  Within the organization web-presence has come to be regarded as the officiating act recognition of an internal group\u0026rsquo;s merit.\n  Different people within the organization have strong opinions about how the world should view the organization — which are reflected in what they think the organization should say about itself — including the interactions that the organization provides to the people who interact on its website.\n  Globally, the Internet is going mobile, and SIL struggles between generating the informatic thrill need to entice donors, visual storytelling needed to facilitate product distribution and training needs of its product users, and high level information needs of politicians, and staffs of other NGOs to seed future partnerships.\n  Quantitatively, most people come to SIL.org to learn about linguistics, or the plethora of digital tools that SIL distributes via sil.org, or the vast number of resources .\n","date":1414022400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1414022400,"objectID":"c3987ebda60cde530b08e1362a559e67","permalink":"https://hughandbecky.us/Hugh-CV/project/2013-sil-org/","publishdate":"2014-10-23T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/Hugh-CV/project/2013-sil-org/","section":"project","summary":"Worked with a team to bring modern features via Drupal 7 to the flagship website of SIL International.","tags":["Architecture","UX","Business","Web-design"],"title":"User Experience Consulting on SIL.org","type":"project"},{"authors":["Hugh Paterson III"],"categories":null,"content":"Referenceable as:\nHugh J.

However, to understand this term, and its usage I think it is important to understand another term used prior to the rice farmer — The Ordinary Working Linguist. This older phrase has gained some traction as evidenced by its adoption in the linguistic literature1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.\nThe OWL or \u0026lsquo;ordinary working linguist\u0026rsquo; is attributed by George Lakoff to Charles Fillmore as a self-describing term. Though it is impossible to say if Fillmore actually coined the term. If he did, then it is an interesting frame by the discoverer of cognitive framing. I have yet to meet an ordinary linguist. I have met smart linguists, extraordinary linguists, novel linguists, quirky linguists, geeky linguists, and ornery linguists — but never an ordinary one. The second issue I take with this contrived frame is that it suggests that somewhere there might be a non-working linguist. Now, either I have never met a lazy linguist, or I have been foiled by some collective endeavor. That is, the linguists I have met have somehow all decided that I am an extremely boring person — the kind to be avoided, and all have feigned busyness! Granted busyness is not the same as \u0026ldquo;working\u0026rdquo;, but I have never met a linguist who is not engaged in some sort of activity which has a mistakable similitude to work!\nAll the same, the notion of \u0026ldquo;OWL\u0026rdquo; seems to be very useful to a large group of linguists. For instance, Gary F. Simons suggests that Helen Aristar Dry proposed a book in the early 1990s with the title Computers and the Ordinary Working Linguist.9, While David Nathan, Peter Austin, Andrew Black, Piotr Bański, Mike Cahill, Jeff Good, Steven Moran, Scott Farrar, and René van den Berg all use the term in their works.\nIn honor of Fillmore, if we take a framing view of the phrase \u0026ldquo;ordinary working linguist\u0026rdquo; we can see that many of the authors are discussing the concept within the frame of linguistic computing — the computer tools that linguists use to do their work. However, it can be argued that there is an SIL specific shift in the framing of the phrase (usage by Cahill, Schroeder, Simons, Black, and van den Berg). Van den Berg\u0026rsquo;s use is most articulate:\n the typical SIL fieldworker is what has been called an ‘owl’, that is, an ‘ordinary working linguist’ who has been given enough training to enable him or her to do the job; this is usually a minimum of two semesters of field linguistics at graduate level. A typical SIL field worker is therefore very much a generalist, without specialist knowledge in any branch of linguistics.\n Van den Berg\u0026rsquo;s usage is both confirmed and then contrasted by SIL International on its website where it contrasts the term with Linguistics Coordinators, Linguistics Consultants, and International Linguistics Advisors. It is clear to see that within the shared frame by SIL staff, that Linguistic Consultants are those who have more training than typical SIL field workers. For several reasons, including reduced staffing, and paradigm shifts within project management related moral ownership within the tasks of language development, SIL has moved from ex-pat driven projects to nationally staffed and ethnolinguistic community driven projects. SIL\u0026rsquo;s minimally trained \u0026ldquo;OWLs\u0026rdquo; moved up the organizational chart to become project managers/facilitators, leaving open the \u0026ldquo;bottom\u0026rdquo; of the chart, ergo the new need for \u0026lsquo;rice farmer\u0026rsquo; as a newly perceived class of computer user.\nI find the term rice farmer 14 times in the internal SIL International wiki and I find \u0026ldquo;OWL\u0026rdquo; 83 times. These terms surface mostly among SIL computer app developers, but I also hear them used by SIL policy and procedures developers, SIL program planners, and SIL educators. To me this term comes off as a class distinction term (and maybe there is nothing wrong with class distinction; I mean the Jews had class distinctions at the time of Jesus, the Cretans had classes at the time of Titus, the British have it, and castes are alive and well in India, etc.10). However, as I find the term being used in SIL, a more transparent term might be \u0026lsquo;low socio-economic and low educational capacity individual\u0026rsquo;.\nThe problem is that in my work with Steve Marlett in Mexico, I worked with ethnolinguistic moronity language users who were not \u0026lsquo;low educational capacity individuals\u0026rsquo; rather they were high educational capacity individuals. When I went to Malaysia and worked with Sean Conklin, the same thing, ethnolinguistic minority language users were not low educational capacity individuals. When I went to Nigeria and worked with people like Becky Paterson and David Rowbory, the people doing language work with us were not low educational capacity individuals. In fact the Nigerian rice farmer/pastor/student/translator/cultural guide/language activist who was on our language project team can and does use ELAN after some training (and uses Facebook without training to boot — FYI: I need training on ELAN too!). So, why then do SIL staff use terms like \u0026lsquo;rice farmers\u0026rsquo; when they talk about designing software for users? Something seems to be wrong with this picture. My guess is that there is a real reason why SIL staff use the term, but it is not the reason that SIL staff attribute as the causation of the observation of \u0026ldquo;low educational capacity individuals\u0026rdquo; - as we observe dark skinned colleagues who try and use SIL software and don\u0026rsquo;t intuitively know how to use the tools. My guess is that the reason for the use of the term is because it is part of the SIL corporate ethos. SIL staff use (or at least have in the past) their educational courses at various SIL training events as filters to find the \u0026lsquo;best and brightest students\u0026rsquo; and recommend those for various field service within SIL. Then in the advanced classes SIL staff obfuscate the materials just to make them harder, to see if those same students are able to still keep up. So, as I see it, there seems to be this undefined class difference in SIL\u0026rsquo;s corporate sociology preferring those who can distill obfuscated communications under stress and dis-preferring those who cannot distill obfuscated signals under stress.\nSo for the following four reasons I strongly dis-prefer the terms \u0026lsquo;rice farmer\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;OWL\u0026rsquo; as they often appear in SIL discourse:\n I don\u0026rsquo;t think the \u0026lsquo;rice farmer\u0026rsquo; terminology is actually very useful for professional reasons. Software design is about communicating. It is about communicating relational concepts in a visual context. It is about connecting new analogies with salient concepts. User Interface (UI - what a software user sees and interacts with) is the gateway to User Experience (UX - the emotional, logical, task based context of activities that are attempting to be facilitated by the software designer and accomplished by the software user). Therefore what UX is really about is communicating ideas and creating positive and successful interactions. If the UI fails to create the designed UX then it doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter if the user is a rice farmer or a Ph.D. candidate from an Australian university. The end result is that the user is frustrated and will not use the software willingly. Therefore, singling out the \u0026lsquo;rice farmer\u0026rsquo; from the white guy is not really a useful construct because all users, whether black, white, tan, farmer, or stockbroker, are subject to the same constraints and frustrations of software which is not intuitively implemented. It is my experience that programmers (not just SIL programmers) usually do not intuitively know how application users think or behave. UX design is an art and a science that takes experimentation and a solid grasp of information design principles. Let\u0026rsquo;s not forget that, at least in software design we are talking about the \u0026lsquo;rice farmer\u0026rsquo; with a computer, an iPad, or an android device. We never use the American Corn Farmer, or the Norwegian Reindeer Rancher as analogies, and I am a bit tired of singling out people from tropical areas because their skin is darker, or their average height is shorter, or because they grow rice in their backyard. The focus on the \u0026lsquo;rice farmer\u0026rsquo; does not help us deal with the white guy\u0026rsquo;s problem with the software and robs us of a balanced view of the real communication challenge. Using the term \u0026lsquo;rice farmer\u0026rsquo; seems to put the ethnolinguistic minority language users and nationals in a sub-standard class relative to \u0026lsquo;real linguists\u0026rsquo; or \u0026lsquo;real missionaries\u0026rsquo;. Yes, my African colleagues who do have their own farms and families, also use SIL software; I first drove a tractor at age 13 and grew up on a farm, so what is the difference? By making the \u0026lsquo;OWL\u0026rsquo; or the \u0026lsquo;rice farmer\u0026rsquo; as some uninitiated or limited capacity person, the \u0026ldquo;reason\u0026rdquo; for new design (i.e the reason that WeSay was created to work with FLEx) doesn\u0026rsquo;t solve the fact that even for highly-educated-white-professionals FLEx is still confusing. The issue is a visual communications issue not a smarts or intelligence issue. Linguistic concepts can be communicated about beautifully and communicated simply, both in the classroom and in software.   I hope this post motivates those in SIL to take a deeper look at User Experience issues in the software tools and websites we build.\n  Bański, Piotr. 2010.

Economic theories have proposed that platforms or, two-sided markets, need to appeal to the needs of both sets of audiences which are connected via the platform. While traditional web-based metrics like clickthroughs, time-on-page, and “hits” can be a good start to assessing the use of a web service, these metrics are not sufficient indicators of the value of the service or to the position of the service within the ecology in which it participates. In order to assess propositional value, market wide metrics are needed. This would include metrics for how people who don’t use OLAC access language based resources. The success and impact of OLAC’s services can be measured by observable statistics or by statistics of non-participation. Interpretation of statistics relating to non-participation can be seen either as an indication that it doesn’t work, or as an opportunity. It is suggested here that they are seen as an opportunity, and as an indicator of OLAC’s position in a two sided market - connecting language artifact holders with language artifact users, and language artifact creators with language artifact holders/maintainers.\nAn ongoing criticism of OLAC’s engagement architecture is that it has specifically targeted Institutions, to aggregate their knowledge of their holdings, rather than directly engaging individuals to share what they know.1 In terms of the total number of people who know about resources which pertain to language (or language artifacts), there are a lot more people who know about language artifacts than institutions who know about the location of language artifacts. This is evident by the results of the LangDoc Project.2 In this project several contributors pooled their collective knowledge and produced a bibliography of 252,923 resources, which is available to other researchers, and sortable by language.\nThere are three classes of important entities to target for participation in OLAC, the institutional repository (and their administration policies, not just collection curators), the individual, and the publishing house. With the third wave of publishing now well underway, the distinctions between these three classes are sometimes confused. Individuals are important because it is through individuals that opinion and usefulness is determined. Individuals are the movers and shakers, not institutions - even if they are part of an institution, but it is the institutions which bring stability. Publishers are important because many new items are first released by them (defining publishers broadly as conferences, institutionally hosted CVs, as well as more traditional publishers). Archives, and digital repositories, play an important role, but transactionally, their frequency of use is lower than that of publishers. Archives are rapidly becoming the publishers of academic multi-media artifacts. Yet Archive collections are generally large and very lucrative for the effort to make their indexes available.\n  A second criticism is perhaps a lack of tangible stories of impact. That is, how has participating in OLAC actually brought benefit to an archive\u0026hellip; not just in theory but with real testimonies. There is no indication that the stats that OLAC provides via its own site is not from bots. Where are the real User Experience Pathways and testimonies for meeting the discoverability need? \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n The LangDoc Project evolved into the Glottolog. \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n   ","date":1400074545,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1400074545,"objectID":"607ff7a4a3f4b789dbaf5c34fc336239","permalink":"https://hughandbecky.us/Hugh-CV/post/olac-success/","publishdate":"2014-05-14T14:35:45+01:00","relpermalink":"/Hugh-CV/post/olac-success/","section":"post","summary":"An information ecology look at the Open Language Archives Community with an eye towards expanding perceived utility.","tags":["OLAC","Metadata","Information ecology","Metrics"],"title":"OLAC Success","type":"post"},{"authors":["Hugh Paterson III"],"categories":["Jot"],"content":"Part of organizational growth is the ability to project consistency while still retaining felxibility. However, in cases of institutional learning, especially where staff are cyclical, the context of organizational choices must be made clear for memory.\nOver the years SIL International has published many pieces of software. Often under liberal licenses. In the case of fonts, no suitable license existed and so SIL developed the Open Font License, which went on to become an de facto standard within the font producing community. In reflection, it occurs to me that every time a new license is produced it is done as a response to a social context. That is, society has delivered a certain set of norms or reactions to existing ownership and licensing practices. It also occurs to me that with each new license created that there is an increased availability of licensing options to potential license users. I was recently reading over SIL International\u0026rsquo;s LSDev\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;literature\u0026rdquo; or summary on why they are licensing their products a certain way (LSDev is a different sub-organizational group than the one which developed the Open Font License). I repeatedly found the phrase (or something like it): \u0026ldquo;This was the best license to meet SIL\u0026rsquo;s goals\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; the bone I have to pick is that as a social group or organization, SIL\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;goals\u0026rdquo; are going to change and have changed. Rather than point to vague referencing terminology (which face being interpreted differently over time, even though the words might not change), these goals should be outlined in such documents. This is the same kind of linking to business reasons that are required (but often missing) for UX documentation. Often times our documentation includes what was done, but not why we did it. When writing documentation we out to strive to include enough of the context to make it clear for organizational learning as well as to determine at some future time if the social context and/or goals of our business has changed enough to warrant a reassessment of our past actions.\n","date":1387719345,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1387719345,"objectID":"13943306f2d5e1ebbfe805be541132de","permalink":"https://hughandbecky.us/Hugh-CV/post/and-why-that-license/","publishdate":"2013-12-22T14:35:45+01:00","relpermalink":"/Hugh-CV/post/and-why-that-license/","section":"post","summary":"Part of organizational growth is the ability to project consistency while still retaining felxibility.

The purpose was to kickstart and provide ideas for the organization I work for to consider alternative models of information maintenance and dissemination. The following links are more or less my list of references which did not make into that paper.\nEconomically (in terms of information economy), the problem I see with CommonCore as it is implemented in the USA across grades 1-12, is that law and policy affect the kinds of resources being produced and subsequently also shared in these curriculum development co-op endeavors (OER). I think the impact is greater than originally anticipated (or perhaps not, perhaps this is a foreign policy move affecting exports of knowledge). The indirect impact of CommonCore on the consumers of these OER materials, is that when people from other countries consume Open Education Resources, they are consuming CommonCore. Thankfully, there is a lot of OER work going on at the university level and outside of the scope of CommonCore.\nAlso to note: OER works well with some subjects in which there is very little change; like science (chemistry and physics) or math. There is so much ground to cover in these subjects that OER makes sense. However, for subjects like linguistics, where models are proposed all the time, and subsequently challenged, it is harder to produce an OER resource with a lot of buy-in among educators.\nGeneral   MIT\u0026rsquo;s Open courses  California\u0026rsquo;s Open Textbook Project  ck-12 open learning platform  Merlot II  The Concord Consortium  OER focusing on Africa  Digital Textbooks    Reconsidering the Textbook: Bierman, P., C.

At one level this is rather trivial to do and has the backing of comercial media processes like subtitles in movies. However, at another level this task is often done in XML for every project (digital corpus curation) slightly differently. At the macro-scale the argument is that if the annotation of the audio is in XML and someone wants to do something else with it, then they can just convert the XML to whatever schema they desire. This is true.\nHowever, one antidotal point that I have not heard in discussion of time aligned texts is specifications for Audio Dominant Text vs. Text Dominant Audio. This may not initially seem very important, so let me explain what I mean.\nAudio Dominant Text Are those texts which were first captured orally. They are a performance. The content may be prepared (in the sense of the telling of a traditional epic), but they are not read texts. They are given from memory. The text lives. In terms of time aligned transcription, from this performance is transcribed. This oral text type stands in contrast to the Text Dominant Audio.\nText Dominant Audio Text dominant audio is where a text is read, scripted or prompted. Several examples of this exist, a radio drama, a cartoon/animated film, a reading. In linguistics a wordlist would also classify. The guiding principle is What is guiding the audio? Is it the structure of the text based document or is it the image of the oral segment as it comes to the speaker spontaneously without visual or interactive reliance?\nThis difference should be noted in metadata durring oral text collection durring language documentation projects. In one project I was involved in, several speakers were recored who were reading texts which they had composed, written and typed. Some editorial help was provided by the PI on some of the texts. These texts now exist as both oral and written texts (in terms of modality). But is the written form a transcription? I doubt it. It is like the inverse of a transcription. The oral but these texts can be presented online similarly to Nick Thieberger’s presentation of text through EOPAS. Example: http://www.eopas.org/transcripts/65.\nI guess in terms of XML, my outstanding question is: How should the structure be represented? If the reading is only a reading, then should the text be head in the XML document and the audio matched to that? Obviously some would say that even readings are performances and I do agree to an extent. However, even with these performances because the non-spontaneous nature of the delivery, and the previous editing of the text, is there a smoothing out of the text which might be equivalent to removing dialectical syntactic variation?\n","date":1363613745,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1363613745,"objectID":"e53e94e567e3bbec04d54a8b69693c3d","permalink":"https://hughandbecky.us/Hugh-CV/post/audio-dominant-texts-and-text-dominant-audio/","publishdate":"2013-03-18T14:35:45+01:00","relpermalink":"/Hugh-CV/post/audio-dominant-texts-and-text-dominant-audio/","section":"post","summary":"Should there be a display difference between read texts and oral texts which are not read?","tags":["Audio","File Structure","Language Documentation","Linguistics","Text","Texts","XML","Interlinear Glossed Text","Transcription"],"title":"Audio Dominant Texts and Text Dominant Audio","type":"post"},{"authors":["Hugh Paterson III","Jeremy Nordmoe"],"categories":null,"content":"   Bibliography for Poster  Anderson, Stephen P. 2006.

Along with that instance of DSpace, it also launched a software application (RAMP) which allows users to bundle electronic resources with the associated metadata for submission to DSpace (Nordmoe 2011). As the archive has deployed and supported this software it has encountered several ongoing challenges. This paper focuses on three factors which are affecting the success and use of RAMP. Broadly, these include: \n\n * User expectations - the metadata schema remains too complex for some usersʼ preference.\n\n* Organizational implementation - the failure of some parts of the institution to deploy the software.\n\n* User adoption - during the first 18 months approximately 15% of staff have routinely archived data through RAMP.\n\nIn todayʼs digital environment, interactions and their resulting success or failure to achieve specific business goals are ever more dependent on the user experience design. User Experience starts before the user has contact with the software but continues through the use cycle of that software to include issues like the infrastructure available for software support and the pleasure derived by the software user during use.\n\nRAMP is designed to facilitate the accession of items and to assist the archivist in identifying the items submitted by linguists. In its current design RAMP is heavily biased in solving the archivistʼs problems related to the organization of archived language materials. For the linguist, this means learning the archivistʼs terminology and learning how to work a tool designed from an archivist perspective. For successful communication between archivists and linguists to occur, these issues must be addressed through user experience design.","tags":["Archive"],"title":"Challenges of Implementing a Tool to Extract Metadata from Linguists: The Use Case of RAMP","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Hugh Paterson III"],"categories":["Research Note"],"content":"I have been thinking about the language data marketplace (exchange if one prefers), and the role of archives in a world where minority language speakers are also internet users and digital file consumers. In particular I have been thinking about SIL’s Language and Culture Archive and the economic model called a two sided market. So, SIL as “Partners in Language Development” seems to be well situated for analysis using the two sided market analysis (matching linguist and professionals with language development skills, and persons with language development skills with interested parties in developing their language). On the surface, it seems that the SIL archive would also benefit from being the center of exchange between these same two groups. This is the subject of one of my slides for an upcoming presentation, therefore I sketched out the interactions various SIL staff might have with the archive to see if I could diagram the social interactions around language data in SIL’s two sided market. To my surprise, the two sided nature of access to data in the archive is not supported, thereby blocking a data-centric archiving service. It makes me wonder what the perceived value of the archive really is, and if the perceived value is low, then why bother? What is the return on investment (ROI) for users on either side of the market?\nI tried to summarize the relationships between the various clients of the archive in the following image.

It started with some felt needs in the SIL International Training Department where I was working. We were seeking to better automate and craft the SIL course catalogue, professional development plans, and course content, while providing instructors clear access to known resources they could use in their learning events. This work involved conceptualizing the course catalogue from both the training and human resources points of view along with supporting resources. SIL\u0026rsquo;s training events are SIL licensed or implemented under contract at partner institutions of higher education. Often the contracted instruction is done via independent-ish SIL branded organizations often refereed to as SIL Entities e.g., SIL Peru, SIL Philippines, etc. Entities are often a geographical locus of operations and work out their own partnerships and resource management strategies. The SIL Language \u0026amp; Culture Archive maintains specific collections for each SIL entity, one of those collections is usually for training resources. Connecting these resources to competencies is important for understanding the use, value, and re-use capability of the resource. I started looking out at how this connection between resource and competency was solved in the larger professional space. In the process I was introduced to the Learning Resource Metadata Initiative (LRMI) and Learning Object Metadata (LOM) communities. My work in this capacity resulted in a recommendation to SIL to integrate LRMI into the archive for instructional materials dealing with linguistics along with mother-tongue based literacy materials. SIL choose that this was not a corporate priority. However, in the process I realized that the language revitalization community at large also has the same challenges.

The objection has been that it is just bad form. While I am a great advocate of personal privacy (especially in digital formats), I see that one of the most informative parts of the language documentation process is understanding who the speakers being recording or being worked with are. Language variation is fundamentally connected with identity. While crucial elements of how a community segments itself along identity lines may not be known for several years, having a robust socio-cultural or socio-personal questionnaire about the language informants will later help place the documentation data in perspective of the larger waves of variation in the community.\nThis is to say, I am thoroughly convinced that a socio-linguistic questionnaire is important as part of the language documentation process. It might not need to be done first, but it will help researchers and future users of archived material understand where to place these speech samples in context of that speakers society.\nOne outstanding question, and one with a variable answer is how to appropriately approach the questions in the questionnaire. Should the questionnaire be approached formally? Or should it be asked in conversational format? Should it be elicited digitally? One of the interesting things about eliciting things digitally is that they may have the appearance to be less intrusive because they are appear less formal. While I have no empirical evidence based on years of cross-cultural work, I do have the Facebook phenomena. That is, minority-language users all over the world are using Facebook. And Facebook is collection (and allowing the users to volunteer) and then verifying the users\u0026rsquo; provided data. Granted it is completly probable that many of these minority-language users do not understand or appreciate the impact of Facebook\u0026rsquo;s data elicitation scheme. So while the fact that Facebook is collectiong personally identifying information about people and their online habbits doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean that the field of language documentation doesn\u0026rsquo;t need to grapple with this issue, it does reset the social understanding of what is \u0026ldquo;normal\u0026rdquo;.\n  Facebook User Base Graph from 2010 Credit: Facebook    Below is a list of elements which Facebook is collecting (it is also collecting log-in locations and times). So, some of these questions are certainly in-scope of what language documenters would minimally like to know about their indigenous language speaking informants and collaborators. Others of these questions are certainly not in-scope for the recommended socio-linguistic profile from language documenters or socio-linguists.\nFaceBook data catagories on user profiles Data Facebook Collects about users through their profile and activities. from: https://www.facebook.com/help/326826564067688 on 23 August 2012.\n   What info is available?

This paper explores keyboard design issues involved in designing two keyboards for two different established orthographies. Both orthographies are based on Latin scripts and cover a total of five minority languages in Mexico (four languages in the Meꞌphaa genus and Sochiapam Chinantec [[cso](https://iso639-3.sil.org/code/cso)] ). The design issues consider: \n\n 1. Technical differences encountered across major computer operating systems (OS X and Windows). \n\n 2. Computer culture issues like the keyboard layout of the national language. \n\n 3. Key stroke frequency of language specific segments. \n\n 4. Unicode/non-Unicode issues related to character composition.\n\n  Designing a Unicode keyboard for data input allowed native speakers of Meꞌphaa to have a greater involvement in the data collected by feeding the documentation team typed data and texts in addition to providing oral data. Early adaption of digital input methods may prove to better meet the needs of both language community and researcher. By giving the language community a keyboard for their orthography the minority language speakers were given the opportunity to enter into, and use, new technological domains with their language.","tags":["Text Input"],"title":"Keyboard layout as part of language documentation: The case of the Me'phaa and Chinantec keyboards","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Hugh Paterson III"],"categories":["Jot"],"content":"I have been doing some thinking about what would make OLAC search more valuable to its current users and to its targeted users. One of the things which would make it more useful would be if the NSF, a partial funder for OLAC and OLAC search, would aggregate its language related grants, scholarships, fellowships and awards through OLAC.\nSome of these Grant proposals are really well written, and well cited documents which explain a certain snapshot of the language situation. Even the announcements that a grants like From Endangered Language Documentation to Phonetic Documentation has been awarded would allow other researchers to know that someone has applied or been awarded a block of funding to work on a particular language situation.\n  Notice of NSF Grant award Credit: NSF     I was particularly happy to find that NSF does have a grant offering and grant awarded search section.

Things like RDF, METS, Dublin Core, .ris and BibTeX. In some ways these things are related – they are metadata. But in other ways they are different animals.\nIn my search I have found two very different classes of metadata schemes based on two different kinds of end users.\n End users who are machines (Metadata for interoperability or resource discovery). End users who are human.  End Users who are machines are usually concerned with the interoperability of metadata for search, storage, and advertisement. These kinds of systems usually are engineered to use metadata schemes like Dublin Core, MODS and METS. Often these systems are able to communicate high level metadata in generic categories.\nHowever, End Users who are human are usually concerned with purposing the metadata in creative processes. And in general, desire to use and appropriate more specific elements of metadata. This is especially true with citation metadata. Students and researchers want to be able to build bibliographies with the data. Additionally, Many of the more detaied metadata elements, that is, overly detailed from a Dublin Core perspective (i.e. can include geo-location name, or a Latitude value or an Altitude value), could be classified as technical metadata according to the first listing below. However, technical metadata is especially relevant for users of audio objects and graphic objects (photos and moving picture objects).\nOf those users looking to use metadata to construct bibliographies and citations, they are often looking for that metadata in the interchange formats of either BibTeX, Endnote XML or .ris. Of those users interested in finding things based on technical metadata, such as audio technicians, linguists, ethnographers, and ethnomusicologists, they are looking to use the metadata and the object it describes in a workflow. And in order to purpose that media object as they need to, those users need to make sure that the digital object fits their workflow criteria.\nThis discrepancy between Metadata for System to System transmission and Metadata for End Users creates a bit of a complext situation, in that delivery systems need to consider both sets of users.\nWhich information to record? Often times no single metadata schema (set of contoled vocabularies and fields) will fill all the kinds of information a project or managment practice requires to be recorded. This means that project staff will need to choose which metadata fields best fit their situation from a variety of schemas. The result is a home-grown schema called an application profile. JISC Digital Media from the UK has a really good article on what how to select elements and their purpose in your application profile and workflow.1 In general though one needs to work through the following catagories and ask questions in each phase to determine if which information needs to be retained in each step. In this sense then, structured metadata is divided into four broad categories that contain information which is defined by the schemas or extension schemas being used:\n Structural metadata. This is information about the structural relationship with other parent or family files and how the metadata relates to the file. Descriptive metadata. This is information about the content of the digital file. The information recorded here is more curatorial than technical, and is the primary portal for users to access your resource. Data including File name, creator, associated dates, description, summary, locations etc should be standardised using a interoperable schema such as Simple DC or MODS. Administrative metadata. This contains information about the analogue source material, the rights of the content and any preservation information. Information here provides support to the managerial team of the collection and researchers in organising and providing access to the resource. Information about rights, ownership and usage restrictions is also kept within the administrative metadata. Technical metadata. To make good use of the digital object data is required which describes the technical qualities of the physical and/or digital object. This includes information such as channel number, bit-depth, sampling rate, and the unique file identifier. AudioMD, is an XML based schema that has been designed primarily for this purpose. It is soon to be superseded by AES-X098, developed by the Audio Engineering Society, upon its formal release.  Though it is possible to separate out some finer grained metadata categories. Consider the differences from above and those below which were part of my post about Metadata for Socio-linguistic Corpora:\n Descriptive meta-data: supports discovery, attribution and identification of resources created. Administrative meta-data: supports management, preservation, and appropriate usage of resources created.  Technical: About the machinery used to create the resource and the technical aspects of the resource. Use and Rights: Copyright, license and moral ownership of the items.   Structural meta-data: maintains relationships between the parts of complex, multi-part resources (Citation: Spanne,\u0026#32; 2008) Spanne,\u0026#32; J. \u0026#32; (2008). \u0026#32;Metadata: Why, What and How (the “Who” is You).   . Situational: this is metadata which describes the events around the creation of the work. Asking questions about the social setting, or the precursory events. It follows ideas put forward by (Citation: Bergqvist,\u0026#32; 2007) Bergqvist,\u0026#32; H. \u0026#32; (2007). \u0026#32;The role of metadata for translation and pragmatics in language documentation. Language Documentation and Description,\u0026#32;4.\u0026#32;163–173.\u0026#32;Retrieved from\u0026#32; http://www.elpublishing.org/PID/055  . Use metadata: metadata collected from or about the users themselves (e.g. user annotations, number of people accessing a particular resource) (Citation: Joint Information Systems Committee (JISC),\u0026#32; 2010) Joint Information Systems Committee (JISC)(2010,\u0026#32;3/14).\u0026#32;Retrieved from\u0026#32; http://www.jiscdigitalmedia.ac.uk/crossmedia/advice/an-introduction-to-metadata/    In that post I also said:\n I think it is only fair to point out to archivist and to librarians that linguists and language documenters do not see a difference between descriptive and non-descriptive metadata in their workflows. That is sometimes we want to search all the corpora by licenses or by a technical attribute. This elevates the these attributes to the function of discovery metadata. It does not remove the function of descriptive metadata from its role in finding things but it does functionally mean that the other metadata is also viable as discovery metadata.\n Compare and match three My goal here is to compare Doublin Core with BibTeX. There is a nice cross-walk technology for BibTex resources in source-forge with some .ris support.2 In terms of resources there is a list of mappings3 not .ris or Bibtex to DC but many other crosswalks. I started my own Crosswalk work in Google Spreadsheets here. I started with roles but also have an interest in item types for use in XLingPaper.\nBibliography   Bergqvist (2007)  Bergqvist,\u0026#32; H. \u0026#32; (2007). \u0026#32;The role of metadata for translation and pragmatics in language documentation.

Part of the discussion at the workshop was on how we can make corpora which are collected by Sociolinguists available to the larger Sociolinguistic community. In particular the discussion I am referencing revolved around the standardisation of metadata in the corpora. (In the discussion it was established that are two levels of metadata, \u0026ldquo;event level\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;corpus level\u0026rdquo;.) While OLAC gives us some standardization about the corpus level metadata, the event metadata is still unique to each investigation, and arguably this is necessary. However, it was also pointed out that not all \u0026ldquo;event level\u0026rdquo; metadata need to be encoded or tracked uniquely. That is, data like date of recording, name of participants, location of recording, gender (male/female) of participant, can all be regularized across the community.\nWith the above as preface, it is important to realize that we do need to understand that there are still various kinds of metadata which need to be collected. In the workshop it was acknowledged that the field of language documentation was about 10 years ahead of this community of sociolinguists.1 So, I will take an example from the metadata write-up I did for the Meꞌphaa language documentation project. In that project we collected metadata about:\n People Equipment  Equipment settings during recording   Locations Recording Environments  Times Situations   Linguistic Dynamics Sociolinguistic Attitudes  In the following diagram I illustrate the cross cutting of a corpus with these \u0026ldquo;kinds\u0026rdquo; of metadata. The heavier, darker line represents the corpus, while the medium heavy lines represent the \u0026ldquo;kinds\u0026rdquo; of metadata. Finally, the lighter lines represent the sub-kinds of metadata, where the sub-kinds might be the latitude, longitude, altitude, datum, country, and place name of the location.\n  Things to measure Credit: Hugh Paterson III    This does not mean that the corpus does not also need to be cross cut with these other \u0026ldquo;sub-kinds\u0026rdquo;. However, these sub-kinds are significantly more in number and will very from project to project. Some of these metadata kinds will be collected in a speaker profile questionnaire. But some of these metadata can only be provided with reflection on the event. To demonstrate the cross cutting of these metadata elements on a corpus I have provided the following diagram. It uses categories which were mentioned in the workshop and is not intended to be comprehensive. In this second diagram, the cross cutting elements might themselves be taxonomies. They may have controlled vocabularies or they may have an open set of possible values, they may also represent a scale.\n  Taxonomies for social demographics and social dynamics for speakers in corpora. Credit: Hugh Paterson III    Both of these diagrams tend to illustrate what in this workshop were referred to a \u0026ldquo;event level\u0026rdquo; metadata, rather than \u0026ldquo;corpus level\u0026rdquo; metadata.\nA note on corpus level metadata v.s. descriptive metadata There is one more thing which I would like to say about \u0026ldquo;corpus level\u0026rdquo; metadata. Metadata is often separated out by function. That is what does the metadata allow us to do, or why is the metadata there? I have been exposed to the following taxonomy of metadata types though course work and in working with photographs and images (Citation:  et al.,\u0026#32; 2009) \u0026#32;\u0026amp;\u0026#32;(2009).\u0026#32;Retrieved from\u0026#32; http://www.photometadata.org/node/46  . These classes of metadata are also similar to those posted by JISC Digital Media as they approach issues with Metadata for digital audio (Citation: ,\u0026#32; 2010) (2010,\u0026#32;1/25).\u0026#32;Retrieved from\u0026#32; http://www.jiscdigitalmedia.ac.uk/audio/advice/metadata-and-audio-resources/  .\n Descriptive meta-data: supports discovery, attribution and identification of resources created. Administrative meta-data: supports management, preservation, and appropriate usage of resources created.  Technical: About the machinery used to create the resource and the technical aspects of the resource. Use and Rights: Copyright, license and moral ownership of the items.   Structural meta-data: maintains relationships between the parts of complex, multi-part resources (Citation: Spanne,\u0026#32; 2008) Spanne,\u0026#32; J. \u0026#32; (2008). \u0026#32;Metadata: Why, What and How (the “Who” is You).   . Situational: this is metadata which describes the events around the creation of the work. Asking questions about the social setting, or the precursory events. It follows ideas put forward by (Citation: Bergqvist,\u0026#32; 2007) Bergqvist,\u0026#32; H. \u0026#32; (2007). \u0026#32;The role of metadata for translation and pragmatics in language documentation.

That is sometimes we want to search all the corpora by licenses or by a technical attribute. This elevates the these attributes to the function of discovery metadata. It does not remove the function of descriptive metadata from its role in finding things but it does functionally mean that the other metadata is also viable as discovery metadata.\nBibliography   Bergqvist (2007)  Bergqvist,\u0026#32; H. \u0026#32; (2007). \u0026#32;The role of metadata for translation and pragmatics in language documentation.

It seems to me as a new practitioner that the chief difference between these two types of corpora is the self identifying quality of researcher. That is does the researcher self-identify as a Sociolinguist or as a Language Documenter. Both types of corpora attempt to get at the vernacular, and both types of corpora collect sociolinguistic facts. It would seem that both corpora are essentially the same (give or take a few metadata attributes). \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n   ","date":1326271298,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1326271298,"objectID":"b0a2043f2046d41103255ccfaff5670b","permalink":"https://hughandbecky.us/Hugh-CV/post/metadata-dynamics-for-linguistic-and-sociolinguistic-corpora/","publishdate":"2021-03-21T01:41:38-07:00","relpermalink":"/Hugh-CV/post/metadata-dynamics-for-linguistic-and-sociolinguistic-corpora/","section":"post","summary":"This is an explanation of some diagrams I made at the LSA's 2012 Satellite Workshop for Sociolinguistic Archival Preparation.

The total recording act has a performer, performing the speech act, a microphone recording the sounds, a recording device digitizing the input from the microphone. And while it could all stop there, an additional step is needed – the monitoring of the input to the recording device. High quality sound is important in the recording process. If the Documenter does not have and ear for what a recording should be (training), then they are not going to be able to tell the difference between a good recording, a mediocre recording and a bad recording. It think it is well known, if not commonly acknowledged that a good mic is needed to make quality recordings (recordings which are faithful at recording the input). Likewise it is no less true that to listen to that recording to assure that it is truly a faithful recording a speaker or set of headphones is needed to produce a faithful output of the recording. So high quality audio (faithfulness to input and to the recording) is not only needed in the capture phase of the recording event but also in the monitoring phase (and the playback phase) of the recording event. Here inter the importance of headphones.\nIt is possible to record with out monitoring the recording but, actively monitoring recorded audio allows for on-the-spot quality control. I have seen some tears shed when a documenter waited till later to find out that the mic record level was set too low or that the record button was not pushed.\nIt is also possible to record with low quality headphones, or headphones which are not faithful to the recording. But when these kinds of speakers or headphones are used there is no way to accurately access the quality of the recording. I have seen a good quality recording played through laptop speakers and questioned as being a “quality” recording. I have also seen a poor quality recording listened to on poor quality speakers and thought it was a fine recording, only to find out later what the true quality of the recording really was.\n Recording volume (or Mic sensitivity) + Speaker volume = Total listening experience.\n Just raising the volume on a speaker or a pair of headphones might make the audio more hearable but does not mean that a good recording is being captured. Conversely, a low speaker volume and a high mic record level does not make a great recording either. (It might be the right setup for your recording session but it does not guarantee a good recording all the time.)\n  Record and Volume Levels.

Speakers Headphones have the distinct advantage over Speakers for not re-introducing noise into a recording, especially in a field recording environment. However, both can be used to monitor a recording. When I recorded in a professional recording studio the mixing room was isolated from the performance rooms and we had Speakers in the mixing room.\nDifferent Uses Different kinds of Headphones serve different purposes. A good knowledge of your purpose and a good knowledge of the right kinds of headphones will lead to a great experience. First, lets take a look at the audio listening needs on a language documentation project.\n Documenter listening to the audio feed while video taping. Documenter listening to the audio while recording. Documenter and Consultant listening to audio while recording with the BOLD method.

Documenter doing analysis and annotation in the field with tools like Audacity, Praat and ELAN. Documenter listening to their iPod in their hammock at night.  With these difference in mind, it is easy to see that various Language Documentation Projects will have different functional requirements depending on the project goals. Additionally, Language Documentation projects often have constraints on their weight of gear to area of service ratios. (Sometimes the documenter just can’t take everything. So take the right tool for the job and hope that tool is light weight.) Headphones come into the equation, as apposed to speakers, because they can deliver high quality sound at a low weight. However, should the language documenter just grab their iPod headphones and think that they will be alright?\nWhat kinds of headphones are there? There are several basic kinds of headphones which can be roughly broken down into 4 types of headphones (Depending on who is consulted.) Types of headphones on:\n  Headphone Reviews  Wikipedia  Apple    Various kinds of headphones as displayed by Apple Credit: Apple, Inc      First, there are over-the-ear headphones or Circumaural headphones which cover the wearers ears completely. These come in two varieties:  Open Back - which lets ambient noise into the wearer's ear canal. Closed Back - which isolates the wearer from noise which is not in the recording.   Second, there are on-the-ear headphones or Supra-aural headphones. Supra-aural headphones sit on the wearers ear rather than covering it completely. Lastly, there are in-the-ear headphones. This group can actually be divided into two sub-groups:  Ear buds, such as the Apple iPod Earphones, which sit in the wearers outer ear, just above the opening of the ear canal. True in-the-ear headphones or In-ear monitors which are actually inserted into your ear canal and isolate the wearer from exterior noise.   How do I know a good set of headphones from a bad set? Well there are several ways we can answer the question as to what is \u0026ldquo;good\u0026rdquo; set of head phones. The most succinct way to say it is likely to be:\nClosed back circumaural, 20-20k. — Will Reiman More generally, consider weight, size, durability, fit, frequency response and price.\nWeight:\nThe Lower the weight the better: less strain on the neck after hours of use and the less weight to carry around with you.\nSize:\nDo they fold up? Are they compact and easy to pack and carry with your other gear?\nFit:\n Are they comfortable for people with large ears? You might not have large ears but if you are asking someone else to wear them then will it be comfortable for them, especially if you are asking them to wear them for a long period of time (long recording sessions). Can they be worn with an over the head mic? Can they be worn by someone wearing glasses? Are they adjustable? Adjustable for head circumference and pronation around the ear.  Quality of sound:\n Frequency response: Frequency response should minimally be 20Hz-20kHz. (because that is generally the range of human hearing.) I like going for 5Hz-30kHz because it gives me a full range of bass. I feel like I am hearing the whole range of sound. Flat response: Just like microphones, speakers (and headphones) can make some frequencies (warmer) try and get a set of head phones which are true to signal (flat response).1    Headphone Frequency Response graph by PCMag comparing three sets of headphones.

Fishman’s scale for measuring Language Vitality and Language Endangerment has been around for about 2 decades (almost longer than me ;-)). The Ethnologue in its most recent version has started to list the position of the language on the EGIDS scale. This is something that the editors are looking to expand to all languages in the Ethnologue. This has some bearing on Language Documentation globally (as grant writers and funders look at EGIDS as a pivot point for language vitality) and because Language Documentation efforts usually (and typically) focus on languages on a 7 or higher on the scale (Shifting, Moribund, Nearly Extinct, etc). Whereas, SIL has largely focused its efforts on languages in a position of 0-6a on the EGIDS scale. (Which it makes sense from the perspective of the Bible Translation movement, where funders of Bible Translation projects are looking at the return on investment for their monies or funds are acquired for very specific tasks in language development work. It also makes sense in terms of managing the human resources of large volunteer organizations Wycliffe and SIL, which are involved in both the Bible Translation Movement and the Language Development Movement – to optimize or economize the effort expended and to focus endeavors and services provided on languages with a higher language vitality [lower EGIDS score] seems a natural fit – languages with a higher EGIDS score are going to receive less Bible Translation dollars because it simply costs more. So herein lies the current conflict: What is recognized as a priority for Language Documentation (stemming from the Endangered Language Movement) is not a priority for other kinds of projects in SIL – the kinds of projects which are funded through SIL’s partners like WycliffeUSA and fundraising campaigns like Vision 2025.\nIf SIL says that “yes” we will engage in language documentation, and says “We will directly engage language communities”; will SIL start where it already has Bible Translation projects? Or will it start with endangered languages as defined by the EGIDS? Funding as an interesting way of adjusting the way people see their priorities. For pragmatic reasons it makes sense for SIL to start where it already has contacts and inroads to communities – even language documentation projects require successful relationships between linguists or language documentation program facilitators and community members. But this does not address how SIL will respond or create language development services for communities who speak languages on the EGIDS scale with a value of 7 or greater. This becomes a concern for SIL consultants and staff as they often have interests in or relationships with communities with an EGIDS score greater than 7.\nAs SIL moves from being an organization which has staff directly involved with activities in language communities, to becoming an organization which provides services to organizations working in communities there has been some discussion about SIL not being the solo organizational partner (where SIL partners directly with the community by sending an SIL staff person to live in the community) in any new start projects in language communities. This kind of strategy, shifts the responsibility for starting new projects to partner organizations and then shifts SIL responsibility to support them with services as it sees fit to provide. In terms of market place presence, this makes lots of sense for a services based company/organization/NGO. However, this also means that as the organization looks to change its involvement in the marketplace, that the market place will also respond and change. That is, the ways in which SIL used to be influential in both linguistics and language documentation, will change. SIL may still be a player but the other players in the larger marketplace of linguistics and language documentation (linguists and linguistic specialists both inside and outside SIL) will rely on SIL for linguistic expertise and data less (unless SIL can successfully provide a service which can offer linguistic expertise and linguistic data – which may be increasingly difficult to do provided the volunteerism basis of many SIL staff).\nTherefore, this kind of EGIDS based decision making and finance steering might work well for focusing services and human resources efforts on Bible Translation projects but I do not see it working well with languages with an EGIDS score of 7 or greater. If SIL’s primary partners are evangelical partners, then on the large scale I do not see those partners as being interested in starting projects (particularly of the language documentation variety) in languages with an EGIDS value of 7 or greater, or the more endangered languages. This really then sets us up for the question: In an SIL framework what is Language Documentation? (including: How much documentation is sufficient for the purposes of the funding partners?, and What can the documentation be used for?) This first question(s) should be followed with a question of the nature: What does that mean for SIL and its operations (services) in other domains?\nBibliography   Lewis\u0026#32;\u0026amp;\u0026#32;Simons (2010)  Lewis,\u0026#32; M.\u0026#32;\u0026amp;\u0026#32;Simons,\u0026#32; G. \u0026#32; (2010). \u0026#32;Assessing Endangerment: Expanding Fishman’s Gids.

EndNote has a long history is published by a reputable company, and has some pretty cool features. I use it (version X4) primarily because it is the only citation software1 which integrates natively with the word processor Pages, by Apple, Inc. The software boasts a bit of flexibility and quite a few useful features. Some of the really useful features I use are below.\n Customizing the output style of the bibliographies.2 Looking for PDF files. Attaching additional meta-data to each citation. (Like ISO 639-3 Language Codes) Adding additional types of resources like Rutgers Optimality Archive Documents with an ROA number. Smart Groups of files based on desired criteria. Integration with Apple\u0026rsquo;s word processor Pages. Research Notes section in the citation\u0026rsquo;s file for creating an annotated bibliography. Copy our all the selected works, so that they can be pasted as a bibliography in another document. XML Output of Citation Data  The XML Support of Endnote has not been hailed as the greatest implementation of XML but there are tools out there to work with it.\n http://www.uns.ethz.ch/pub/publications/xml_format XSL Transformation stylesheet for EndNote XML.  However, regardless of how many good features I find and use in Endnote there are several things about it which irk me to no end. This is sort of a laundry list of these problematic areas.\n  Can not sort by resource type: For instance if I wanted to sort or create a smart list of all my Book references, or just Journal Articles. This can be done, one just has to create a smart list and then set Reference Type to Contains: \u0026ldquo;Book Section\u0026rdquo;. There is not a drop down list of reference types invoked by the user.\n  Can not sort by custom field: I think you can do this in the interface. Though it was not obvious on how to do it.   Endnote Display Fields. Credit: Hugh Paterson III      Can not view all the custom fields for a resource type across all resources. This seems to be limited to eight fileds in the sorting viewer at a time.\n  Can not view all entries without content in a specified field. This would be especially nice to create a smart list for this.\n  No exports of PDFs or exports of PDFs with .ris files.\n  There is no keyboard short-cut to bring up the Import function (or Export) under File Menu\n  Does not rename PDFs based on metadata of the resource. This is possible with Papers and Mendeley. The user has the option to rename the file based on things like Author, Date of publication, etc.\n  Can not create a smart list based on a constant in the Issue data part. I have Volume and Issue Data. Some of the citation data pulled in for some items has the issue set as 02, 03, etc. I want to be able to find all the issues which start with a zero so I can remove the zeros. Most stylesheets do not remove the zeros and also do not allow for them.   Items are not selectable based on Issue Data. Credit: Hugh Paterson III      Can not export PDFs with embedded metadata in the PDF.\n  Can not open the folder which contains a PDF included in an Endnote Library.   Endnote does not have a way to open the containing folder of a PDF. Credit: Hugh Paterson III        Endnote does not have a way to open the containing folder of an included PDF. Credit: Hugh Paterson III     Modifying Resource type does not accept |Language| Subject Language|\n  There is no guide in any of Endnote\u0026rsquo;s documentation for how to create an export style sheet. This is in the Help Menus I was expecting it on the producers website or in a book.\n  When editing an entry\u0026rsquo;s meta-data i.e. the author, or the title of a work, pressing TAB does not move the cursor to the next field. At least some times it does not continue to TAB. If I do a new entry as a Journal article, then it will tab till the issue field, but not beyond. It gets stuck.\n  There is no LAN collaboration or sharing feature for a local network solution.\n  There is no Cloud based collaborative solution.\n  There is no way to create a smart group based off of a subset of items in a normal group. i.e. I want to create a smart group of all the references with a PDF attached but I only want it to pull from the items in a particular group (or set of groups).   Endnote has no option for 'part of group' filter. Credit: Hugh Paterson III      There is no PDF Preview within the application. The existing Preview is for seeing the current citation in the selected citation style. (Preview of the output.) It would be helpful if there was also a preview pane for viewing the PDF or the attached file.   No PDF Preview internal to Endnote. Credit: Hugh Paterson III        There are other citation management software for OS X which claims integration with Apple\u0026rsquo;s Pages but none of these solutions are endorsed or supported by Apple. Some of the other applications which claim integration with Pages are: 1) Sente, 2) Bookends, and 3) Papers - This is according to Wikipedia, but I own and use Papers 1.9.7 and have not seen how to integrate it with Pages. (However, Papers2, released March 8th, 2011 does say that it supports citation integration with Pages.). \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n There are several Linguistics Journals with style sheets on EndNote\u0026rsquo;s website.

It is the goal of this paper to demonstrate how the (inter)dental approximant compares with the claimed phonemic inventory of Proto-Austronesian and to give a possible explanation for the variety of reflexes of *l seen in the Philippine Languages2 (PL). The suggestions in this paper for the phonetic value of *l are based on phonetic detail of the (inter)dental approximant described by Olson and Mielke (2007) and other descriptions from Philippine Languages.\n\n In historical linguistics our assumptions about a proto-language’s phoneme inventory are limited by our understanding of the phoneme inventory of the daughter languages. Without the right observations on the daughter languages, we are liable to make invalid conclusions about their proto forms. There has been a lack of attention given to the phonemic status of the (inter)dental approximant because of its categorization as an allophone of [l] or in the cases of its reflexes with [r].

Rüdiger Köppe Verlag: Köln  Follow-up work:\nIt seems that the interdental approximant [ð̞] in Austronesian languages should challenge linguists in three important areas and thus deserves more thought and perhaps application in our theories. These categories are:\n The phonological status and interactions that happen with the segment. The phonetic contrast of the segment. The Historical status of the segment and the impact of its recognition in the Austronesian historical linguistic narrative.  Publications to date have focused on two relevant aspects of the interdental approximant:\n ð̞ is important in descriptive linguistics. ð̞ is different phonetically from other described segments.  The following remain to be shown clearly in appropriate publications.\nPhonetic contrast\n What is the duration of the sound and what are the boarders? Measure the stable section? Where does it stop and where does it begin? What is the acoustical (in terms of both production and perception) difference between /l/ and /ð̞ /?  The ulturasound study does provide a good starting point to answer these questions.\n  ð̞ it has a unique spectrograph when compared with other liquids, vowels, and interdentals - especially within the same language.\n  ð̞ is different from the native sounds of { l, a, ɐ, n, ʔ, d, g, r, s, h, x} which occur in Philippine languages.\n This has been done in small phonology descriptions but not full scale acoustically reference-able phonetic descriptions across the entire set of languages discussed in the JIPA article.    ð̞ is different from the borrowed sounds of { l, a, ɐ, n, ʔ, d, g, θ, ð, r, s, h, x, ɣ}\n  In terms of psycholinguistics the question remains,: What are the unique properties of this sound as they are culturally defined? or to put this another way: What are the acustic cues, what are the visual cues, and what are the cultural constraints that those cues may violate?\n  My research position suggests that there has been change. Change involves a variety of cognitive processes. Re-analysis is one such process. If I hypothesize that re-analysis has occurred, then what is the Cognitive load of this segment? How has that load shifted or why can it shift?\n  What are the unique properties that users attribute to this segment as cross-linguistically defined (but keeping within Austronesian or the Austro-Tai hypotheses).\n  What are those unique properties as Universally or empirically defined?\n  Historical Narrative\n  There is an open question with relationship to historical Austronesian as to what the metrical structure of the language was. If we posit some change in the metical structrue what relevance does that have on the interdental approximant? Does the concept of Phonetic Gemination apply?\n  In some theories of Austro-Tai there is some relevance to constructing suprasegmental features and genisis or de-genesis processes for these features. In that contexts: Is it possible that ð̞ is a tone bearing unit? (TBU).\n  Interdental is contrastive with dental in Place in the IPA Chart ð̞ is important to PAn Historical Phonology Theory\n  ð̞ is related to several mergers and splits\n  ð̞ is PAn *R\n  ð̞ Shows that [+Nasal], historically, is, or is/and a super-segmental feature in Austronesian languages.\n  ð̞ shows that there are fewer proto-phonemes than necessary in current models of PAn.\n  ð̞ helps us to understand the PAn foot.\n  ð̞ was represented in the baybin original orthography.\n  ð̞ is relevant enough to be represented consistently in orthographies in the languages it occurs in.\nPhonology\nThere are several open phonological questions. Some of these have answers in the cited materials, but the data is not always clear for all languages which also have interdental approximants.\n  What are the claimed Phonemes of kangayen?\n  It would be all the more the claim that ð̞ is phonemic not due to a split. If it is a retention then this perspective has more weight.\n  What is the ð̞ pattern concerning natural classes.\n  In a feature geometry perspective, what features does ð̞ have.\n  Some Austornesian language have Metathesis. Is this metathesis process triggered in any way by the ð̞?\n  ð̞ has moraic value - what is it?\n  What is the affect of ð̞ on vowel quality?\n  In what ways can we measure the impact that ð̞ has on cognitive load?\n  Does the ð̞ occur in multiple areas of the lexicon\n  To do this a survey of the texts should be used to evaluated the location of ð̞ in the lexicon.
