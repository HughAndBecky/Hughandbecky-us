I could take a screenshot save it as a .png or .jpg and call it good. However these sorts of images do not provide a great deal of resolution and do not look clean in a published paper. Especially when dealing with screenshots as the resolution is not very high — at least in my experince. I could print the web page to PDF but a post-script style PDF would basically create an image and wrap it in a PDF. This is not really any better than the screenshot solution.\nWith a quick internet search I uncovered two potential solutions: wkhtmltopdf and WebVector/CSSBox. I decided to try out wkhtmltopdf. It was simple and easy to install on linux. It produces great resutls with a bit of tinkering ( manual here). Though it should be noted that wkhtmltopdf is based on webkit which has mostly not seen progressive development. I also tried WebVector (specifically on the website Pangloss) and it did not produce expected results.\nPlaying around with wkhtmltopdf I was able to produce a PDF of several webpages I was looking to include. I used the following workflow after install:\nI adjusted my screen size to fit the type of display I wanted. Then I measured it via whatismyviewport.com. I took that and made it my viewport size. Then I played around with my output settings for the PDF. I knew that I wanted really low margins because I was going to embed this PDF as a figure in another PDF. Then I continued to play around with the page size to find the cut-off point between the content I wanted and the footer. In the end the code I used looked like this:\nwkhtmltopdf --no-print-media-type --viewport-size 1100 --page-height 6.25in --page-width 7.75in -T 1mm -B 1mm -R 1mm -L 1mm --load-media-error-handling skip --enable-javascript --javascript-delay 2000 https://www.sil.org/resources/archives/52216 sil-item.pdf\nwkhtmltopdf --no-print-media-type --viewport-size 1100 --page-height 8in --page-width 7.75in -T 1mm -B 1mm -R 1mm -L 1mm --load-media-error-handling skip --enable-javascript --javascript-delay 2000 https://scholarspace.manoa.hawaii.edu/handle/10125/30788 K-item.pdf\nwkhtmltopdf --no-print-media-type --viewport-size 1100 --page-height 8.75in --page-width 7in -T 1mm -B 1mm -R 1mm -L 1mm --load-media-error-handling skip --enable-javascript --javascript-delay 2000 http://www.language-archives.org/item/oai:sil.org:52216 olac-item1.pdf\nThis produced a nice PDF. But I needed to get rid of the second page. I did this with PDF-Shuffler and just deleted the second page. I wanted to include the final PDF in XLingPaper which uses XeLaTeX on the back end. However one of the current dependencies only allows PDFs of version 1.4 or older. So I had to \u0026ldquo;back version\u0026rdquo; the PDF version to 1.4. I the following code (adjustin for file names) to do that.\ngs -q -sDEVICE=pdfwrite -dCompatibilityLevel=1.4 -o out.pdf in.pdf My suspicion though is that passing the PDF through GhostSript also removes some of the mark-up features which already exist in the PDF via wkhtmltopdf. This may include some of the links and embedded fonts — but on this last point I am not 100 percent sure.\nIn an earlier version of this workflow I was using standard size pages (A4, A3, etc.). Doing so required that I then cut the PDF so that the usable portion was able to usefully be scaled in xlingpaper. To do this I used pdfresizer.com to reduce the physical dimensions of pdf paes. However this was not necessary to maintain because I was able to specify the dimentions I needed directly in wkhtmltopdf.\n","date":1610668800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1610668800,"objectID":"57ff547f038a3cf84c71ce8eec591b85","permalink":"https://hughandbecky.us/Hugh-CV/post/pdfs-of-webpages/","publishdate":"2019-06-29T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/Hugh-CV/post/pdfs-of-webpages/","section":"post","summary":"A workflow for creating SVG images from PDFs","tags":["xlingpaper","pdf","svg"],"title":"PDFs from Webpages","type":"post"},{"authors":["Hugh Paterson III","Rebecca Paterson"],"categories":[],"content":"About authors in the Biblography Rebecca Paterson\nStuart John McGill\nClark D.

While I am working on a project in the building phase, I am motivated by I how I think people are going to love to touch and look at the finished product. Bringing together form and function, design and engenerring is why I love wood as a medium. Feeling the wood and imagining how others will feel the same thing defines my target level of performance when crafting.

To use Kornai’s (2013) terms, the digital moribund state of languages is accelerated by the lack of intuitive and useful text input methods for many minority and under-resourced languages. Even if text input methods currently exist for a language, it is often the case that they are disruptive (rather than smooth) to the digital text production process, due to inadequately optimized keyboards. This disruption then serves as a barrier to creating vibrant digital communities using these under-resourced languages. What is observed is that users of under-resourced languages often choose to use another language in digital contexts rather than deal with the disruptions of awkward keyboard input requirements. This actually serves to accelerate and solidify the under-resourced language in its moribund “vitality” state. Optimized Keyboard Layouts are an academic pursuit in applied mathematics and computer science which intend to make keyboards intuitive and useful. Despite being language-related resources, keyboards and text input methods are rarely mentioned in the language development literature. Within the computer science literature Yin and Su (2011) situate the optimization of the keyboard in a context known as the general keyboard arrangement problem (GKAP). Their work is well respected, but does not take into account several issues common to the minority-language context, such as keyboards with deadkey interactions, graphemic complexities (such as diacritic usage), and embedded linguistic knowledge (such as tone patterns, or multi-graph functional units). For example, Bi et al. (2012) look at the efficiency of text input with the deadkey method for diacritics, and contrast that with a single keystroke for a “composed” character. They conclude that the deadkey method is more efficient, but they only run their tests on European languages with orthographies that have a diacritic to total character density of less than 4%. Commonly, European languages use diacritics to indicate vowel quality. In contrast, many languages use diacritics to show tone patterns. In preliminary counts of minority-languages in both Mexico and Nigeria, I have encountered diacritic densities of over 30%. This means the extra time and effort it takes to use deadkeys is much more significant in these languages. Paterson (2014) lays a foundation for the kinds of issues encountered by minority-languages typists, as an appeal to creators of resources for under-resourced languages to use design principles (Vitsœ 2012, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services 2018) in the creation of their language resource products. There, I argue that better design of text input solutions, which take into account linguistic knowledge about a language’s orthography, will increase the opportunities for digital vitality in an under-resourced language. It does not, however, present a methodology for assessing the disruptive nature of a text input solution, so we still lack a metric for comparing the relative ease of typing on any given keyboard layout for a given language. There currently does not exist a principled way to evaluate the utility or the application of User Experience principles (Garrett 2002) and design criteria to keyboard layouts. Researchers who have published on the keyboard optimization problem generally evaluate keyboard layouts on the basis of a composite “fitness score”. These scores only take into account the metrics of a single language - generally English - and only do it from an ergonomic perspective. As researchers in the field of language development, we are effectively blind when it comes to our ability to compare efficiency of two proposed keyboard layouts serving the same language,. A good framework does not exist for allowing researchers to ask the question: does QWERTY serve English users equally as well as AWERZY does to French users? - or any number of keyboards and their corresponding minority-languages. Language development practitioners and linguists working in many different languages have created many keyboard layouts. However, linguists have not adequately accounted for the linguistic dissonance between the psycholinguistic and phonemic realities of a spoken language and a speaker’s experience in typing that language. This has created a gap between the “possible to write/type” orthography and the “easy to write/type” orthography. The general keyboard arrangement problem (GKAP) has been situated as a time over distance problem, i.e., speed. The assumption has been that if fingers travel a smaller distance, then faster typing should be the result. A secondary argument to increase speed has been to reduce effort. The assessment of effort has been tied to Fitts’ law (MacKenzie 1992) for measurements of physical effort. However, mental effort or user-perceived effort remains unassessed. By visualizing keystrokes, we can identify the locus of impact in any given language. In language development work it is often the case that low-usage keys in an English-QWERTY layout are replaced with “new characters” to form keyboard layouts. The consequence has been the placement of frequently used keys under weak fingers, as demonstrated by the Meꞌphaa keyboard layout below. Notice the high frequency red(dish) areas and the lower frequency blue areas. These red areas would normally be struck with the pinky fingers.\nFigure 1: Meꞌphaa Keyboard\n\nSpanish, distributes the same amount of information across multiple fingers as shown in Figure 2 below. According to current keyboard layout theory even the Spanish keyboard is heavy on the weaker fingers of the left hand, but at least is better than the Meꞌphaa layout.\nFigure 2: Spanish Keyboard\n\nContrasting these two languages allows us to visualize how they are different with respect to the actions of the pinky finger. It also demonstrates how the attempt to ‘conserve QWERTY’ impacts typing in minority languages. Notice how the Meꞌphaa keyboard layout replaces the Spanish〈ç〉character with a tone diacritic key. Also note that these tone diacritics are very frequent in Meꞌphaa, and create a typing imbalance. Additionally, the Meꞌphaa Saltillo〈ꞌ〉 key is also on the right side with heavy use, further contributing to the typing imbalance. These diagrams demonstrate the part of the keyboard layout analysis that can be computed using existing GKAP methods. What linguists bring to the discussion is an awareness of linguistic components. Orthographies are not just Unicode characters, but are functional units. The encoding of a functional unit can change from orthography to orthography. This is missed by many GKAP researchers. One needs to look beyond Unicode characters and toward ratios of keystrokes to functional units. One way that linguists look at functional units differently than “pure technologists” is in the area of tone. Snider (2014) and Hyman (2014) both argue for an analysis of tone that looks at patterns across the domain of tonal attachment (usually the word or morpheme) rather than the more structuralist and segmental view of “letter plus pitch” which is the encoding method that Unicode follows. The difference in behavior becomes clearer when we contrast reading diacritic tone marks with a language which does not use diacritical marking. Imagine the following example represents the same sentence in two different languages.\nA tone pattern analysis (following Snider and Hyman) would suggest that we should understand the tonally marked sentence to represent the segmental and the suprasegmental tiers separately, something like the following:\nIt is observed, anecdotally, that many writers of tone languages parse the writing task into two activities, one for each tier of information. Usually the segmental tier is completed first and then the suprasegmental tier.\nThis makes the writing activity much like handwriting in the United States where we say: “don’t forget to dot your \u0026lsquo;i\u0026rsquo;s and cross your ‘t’s. The writer first completes the segmental tier and then comes back across with a second pass and completes dots the ‘i’s and crosses the ‘t’s. However, the nature of typing, and Unicode’s structural nature, requires typists to complete the text production task linearly by codepoint. This creates dissonance from what many language users find “natural”, requiring them to frequently alternate their attention between the two tiers, as shown by the up and down movement in the following diagram.\nThe goal of this thesis will be to develop and apply metrics to keyboard layouts so that their ease of use can be analysed and compared. Some optimised keyboards in a few sample languages will also be presented. Preliminary testing of these ideas has been done on English [eng], Spanish [spa], Me’phaa [tcf], and Chinantec [cso], as mentioned in Paterson (2014) and work done with Nigerian languages in Paterson (2015) covering Ezza [eza], Bekwarra [bkv], Cishingini [asg], Okphela [atg], and Igbo [ibo]. However, for this thesis I anticipate focusing on the three following languages: Navajo [nav], Kabiyè [kbp], and Eastern Dan [dnj], and especially the latter two, as they are related languages with very different design decisions in their orthographies, and both have very clear analysis of their tonal systems. This should allow observations about the typing process in one language to be contrasted with another related language. Further, there is a reasonable amount of text to work with in each language. Ultimately the final languages used will depend on the accessibility of corpora content in those languages.\nThis thesis will add to the current GKAP discussion by proposing a theoretical framework and a two-metric algorithm that can be applied to any keyboard layout for any language using a Latin based script. The first metric will account for disruption in the phoneme (or functional unit) stream while engaged in typing, and the second will account for non-character-producing keystrokes, thus addressing the major problem areas outlined above. These metrics will then be combined with a haptic fitness score to produce a fitness score which accounts for linguistic knowledge. This thesis will contribute to the ongoing language development discussion by providing a quality assessment metric for the evaluation of a very important language-based digital product.\nResearch questions The problem to be addressed can be expressed informally like this:\n “We have these keyboards layouts in all these languages, but they are not being used, and in general people find it easier to type in languages other than their mother tongue. To what extent are our keyboards disruptive and thereby impeding language use in digital contexts? Can we measure the disruption?”\n More precisely, the following sub-questions can be addressed in the course of this investigation:\n What percentage of extra work is required to type minority-language texts?\n Here, the “extra work” measurement might be measured in terms of the distance traveled, the time required to travel that distance, and the number of keystrokes, as compared between a language of wider communication and a minority language.\n In a given language, what is the added unnecessary distance when typing text?\n  What are some common traits of excessive use/difficulty in text input keyboards for minority languages, and how can those commonalities of “pain”, be generalized for designers to avoid?\n  Do we account for functional units (e.g. phonemes and tones) independent from character optimization? That is, does optimizing for character input also optimize for functional unit input?\n  Can we predict that with tone languages we will exceed the Hick’s law minimum, whereas in non-tonal languages we can stay under Hick’s law?\n Hick’s law (Hick 1952) is a reference to how performance decreases as temporary memory functions increase, i.e., when we need to hold information in our temporary memory. This can be calculated on the basis of how many characters does one need to type in between the elements of a diacritic digraph.\n How can we measure the dissonance factor for a particular keyboard layout? That is, how much dissonance does a keyboard layout solution induce?\n Dissonance is the cognitively difficult, or non-prefered choices that we must make to achieve the desired results. Dissonance is increased by those things which militate against fluidity, and includes factors such as non-correspondence between keystrokes and functional units, the elements of a digraph, and multiple keystrokes per orthographic character.\nProject specifics To perform the supporting analysis I will use existing texts to form a “corpus of keystrokes” and a “corpus of functional units”. I use the corpus of texts in conjunction with the existing keyboard layout to suggest what the “keystrokes required” would have been to produce a text (assuming 100% accuracy). Given that I am working with corpora, rather than original production data, I will not have actual time-over-distance measurements. I will rather, as is the norm for working with corpora in this context, infer the time to completion for each keystroke based on previously published experiments which show the time it takes to move a finger from one key to another. Then I will look at the functional units and measure (1) how many keystrokes to functional units are required, and (2) how much dissonance is created in the process of typing. Existing keyboard layouts for the languages of the texts in question will be analysed, and scored. Finally, improved keyboard layouts with better scores will be suggested.\nReferences  Xi Bi, BA Smith, S Zhai (2012) Multilingual touchscreen keyboard design and optimization.

Data without community interaction and curation becomes stale and diminishes in value. \n\n 3) When released as OpenData the organization, which in our case does not want to continue to engage in a data curation role, does not continue to retain engagement with the language development activities around the data. \n\n 4) Online communities which do form around 'OpenData' tend for form editorial oligarchies.

It is about breaking down communication silos and working across corporate structures to create a unified workforce. I have the ongoing privilege of consulting with department heads and team leaders on interdepartmental communication and audience engagement strategies. Often this involves creative uses of technology and creating data management plans and publishing work flows. At SIL International we use MailChimp, and Confluence to meet these communication needs.\nSIL International is over 80 years old. A majority of its staff are Baby-boomers. Currently work flows, even digital ones, usually mirror processes set up in paper based work enviroments. SIL International as an organization has organizational units of various sizes in various locations of the world. Many of these units are also distributed teams. In the broader business world the battle for effective team communications is generally characterized as a battle between looking in the inbox and using the browser for information, collaboration, and connectivity. Tools like #slack, and management decisions to look for more effective team communications platforms have tried to push email our of use. In SIL International the very diverse nature of the workforce presents challenges to those with low-bandwidth connectivity.\nWe use a two prong communications approach. Email and corporate blog use. For Email we use Mailchimp. For the corporate blog we use Confluence Wiki.\nSIL International deployed Confluence company wide in 2008 as a white board for people in the organization to use within their organizational unit. By 2011 the wiki had evolved into a platform for departmental websites and had supplanted official information repositories for official documentation. This has made the platform invaluable for interdepartmental communications.\nIn 2015 various organizational units within SIL International started to independently use Mailchimp.\nDue to the highly transitional nature of SIL International staff, it is often the case that SIL staff do not have the knowledge base needed to leverage the capacities of these two systems.

These language users often do not type in their own languages, but rather experience technology through languages other than their first language. This is in part because of the perception that their language is complex or not easy to type, which is often not an invalid observation. However, with these languages which have different and sometimes more characters than English, what does a good layout look like? The objectives of this project are threefold:\n To establish a consistent method to evaluate the appropriateness of a keyboard layout for a specific language situation given a specific text sample. This needs to include deadkeys and alt states.   This needs to account for monolingual situations This needs to account for multi-lingual situations where each language has its own keyboard This needs to account for multi-lingual situations where only a single keyboard is used  Provide a best fit solution recommendation when provided the following:   A corpus of text encoded in UTF-16 or UTF-8 in any language A user selected choice between a physical keyboard layout of ANSI, ISO, or JIS The application providing the best fit solution needs to be able to suggest a better layout, inclusive of alt states and deadkey options.  Assess and analyze real user feedback. That is, measure the impacts of keyboards on users.

In many socio-cultural contexts the ability to input digital text undergirds sustainable social practice of literacy. Simons and Lewis (2010) describe the social practice of literacy (EGIDS levels four and five) as a sign of a healthy language. A text input device which does not intuitively work for language users can be seen as discriminating and be a reason for speakers to choose to not use their language in digital mediums (Trosterud 2012), adversely affecting language development efforts. The challenge then is to provide a digital text input method (1) that works well for the orthography of any given language and (2) that users also find intuitive. \n\n Paterson (2015) presents a framework to evaluate or rank the complexity of the text input task on a per orthography bases. We apply this framework and present the results from five Nigerian languages: Ezza [[eza](https://iso639-3.sil.org/code/eza)], Bekwarra [[bkv](https://iso639-3.sil.org/code/bkv)], Cishingini [[asg](https://iso639-3.sil.org/code/asg)], Okphela [[atg](https://iso639-3.sil.org/code/atg)], and Igbo [[ibo](https://iso639-3.sil.org/code/ibo)]. We discuss relevant user experience (UX) considerations for keyboard layouts and unique actions undertaken in the communicative act of ‘encoding’ language (typing). We follow previous work which focuses on majority language text input methods (Bellman \u0026 MacKenzie 1998, Castellucci \u0026 MacKenzie 2013, MacKenzie 1992, 2002, 2007, MacKenzie \u0026 Soukoreff 2002, Soukoreff \u0026 MacKenzie 2001, 2003a, b) and apply considerations for minority language orthographies - especially those orthographies which overtly mark tone and other distinctions via diacritics. \n\n Many minority language users often find it difficult to type in their languages because of the way that orthography specific and language specific characters are accessed through existing keyboard layouts (Paterson 2014). The keyboard layout is an essential component in text input both on mobile touch screen and traditional devices. Barriers to efficiently using text in digital mediums has a wide impact on language vitality, by affecting the way that language users perceive their language’s viability in the 21st century context. Minority language users acknowledge the difficulty of text input in their languages (Esizmetor 2009: 13, Zheltov 2005). \n\n Perceptions about the need for text based digital communication devices has sufficiently challenged language communities leading some to change their orthographies (South Pacific - Boerger 2007: 133; Central Asia - Cooper 2005: 149, 160; Americas - Jany 2010:235-6). However, it is unclear if the issue is the text input process or some other interaction between users and an orthography. The African context is not immune to these challenges (Bailey 2007). Africa is probably more sensitive to text input difficulties than other geographical regions like the South Pacific because many Roman Script African orthographies overtly mark tone and other distinctions via diacritics.","tags":["Text Input"],"title":"African Languages: Assessing the text input difficulty","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Hugh Paterson III"],"categories":null,"content":"Referenceable as:\nHugh J.

Woodbury (2003) suggests that lexical database resources should become part of the preserved documentary evidence - regardless of decisions to classify lexical datasets (which are often the foundational resources for dictionaries) as ‘language description’ or ‘language documentation’ materials. Language artifacts stewarded by archives are increasingly important in linguistic analysis, in peer review, and to minority language communities. This is in large part due to the impact of language documentation (Himmelmann 1998) on the linguistic sciences. However, as scientists and producers of language material artifacts, do archiving requirements come to us as linguists begrudgingly or do we embrace them? Paterson \u0026 Nordmoe (2013) suggests that among SIL staff there exist over 1 million unarchived minority language related artifacts including a substantial number of lexical databases. Lexical databases are complex resources potentially representing thousands of work-hours in data edits and curating and are valued by a wide variety of users including those who are interested in language revitalization and language descriptions.  \n\n Given the claim by Paterson and Nordmoe that such a large quantity of resources are in danger of being lost, contributing to the “erosion of the base” within linguistics; I think an important question should be asked: _is the volume of unarchived and endangered resources a localized behavioral attribute within a particular social network or is it a linguistics wide phenomenon?_ \n\n In this presentation results are presented which test the hypothesis that quantitative rates of archiving lexical dataset resources are homogeneous between SIL linguists (84 respondents) and non-SIL linguists (78 respondents). Further, an analysis of questionnaire results sent to linguists who self-identified as FLEx or Toolbox users is presented. The results suggest that there is homogeneity between the two groups of respondents with respect to archiving practices and that archiving rates are low compared to the number of lexical databases created. The low ratio of archived lexical databases to unarchived lexical databases has the potential to impact the current and future capacity of linguists, especially where lexical database resources concern endangered languages.","tags":["Lexicography","Archive"],"title":"Lexical dataset archiving: an assessment of practice","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Hugh Paterson III"],"categories":null,"content":"Citable as:\nHugh J.

The aims of the curriculum were identified so as to be consistent with the aims of the Nigerian education system and in particular with the recently expressed aims of the Nigerian social studies curriculum which is intended to foster inter- and cross-ethnic communication and understanding and national identity in a country which contains more than 250 ethnic groups. A consideration of appropriate curriculum content led to the identification of five basic concepts in ethnomusicology and five concepts basic to social studies. The integration of these concepts into a unified curriculum was made through an Identity Approach which permitted the identification of relevant cognitive, affective and skill objectives and indicated appropriate learning processes. Three curriculum units were developed in detail and field tested in upper elementary classes in two elementary schools in southeastern Nigeria. This field testing—the classroom phase of the curriculum development— involved 120 students, ten teachers and the administrators of the schools. The staff were given instruction in the curriculum materials and the Identity Approach following which the students were engaged in twenty-four sessions and covered the three units which had been developed. The results of the classroom phase were studied from students\u0026rsquo;, teachers\u0026rsquo; and administrators\u0026rsquo; opinions and recommendations and their responses to four opinionaires.

Teachers found the project to have contributed to their professional development and both teachers and administrators reported community interest and involvement.

Most of it is fancy talk for \u0026ldquo;How much can you pay me to work on your website\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;. When we get beyond that level of discussion, there are some real issues and methods to building websites that people are proud to own, and proud to use.\nGoogle\u0026rsquo;s search page makes them lots of money and people use it all the time. It even won the popular search war against Yahoo! Facebook has a website that millions of people use every day. At some point a well designed website stops being a website in the minds of users and becomes a place where they work, hangout, arrange meetings, etc. When users stop realizing they are on a website, that is when I feel we have moved into a place in design where we are close to perfect for that situation.\nBetween 2010 and 2016 I worked with a team to bring modern features via Drupal 7 to the flagship website of SIL International. But I have also worked on WordPress sites (not for SIL) since 2005. And I consulted on a variety of other SIL web projects (some of them on WordPress).\nMy work with SIL started with a report that they were not using a print.css file on the SIL Bibliography in 2006 and were wasting a lot of ink when people were printing pages. I think this was corrected by 2009. This was typical for the pace of technical innovative change. SIL is a very corporate feature focused development environment.\nWithin User Experience studies, there is at least two ways to apply the term (UX): The design of experiences that a corporation wants their customers to engage in, and the way that people take an object (product) and decide to use it. Both are important, but how a company approaches either of these facets and how they relate that approach back to their other business goals scopes the relevance of User Experience Design within the organization.\nSuccessful interactions depend on both points of view and the metrics of success.\nSIL.org is an interesting use case in UX design for at least 5 reasons:\n  SIL has several major areas of very public interactions which it engages with to various degrees in various parts of the world — but the Internet is flat.\n Advocacy with public policy making bodies regarding the needs of minority language speakers. Publishing and sales of professional resources and materials. Bible translation. Educational programs (both formal and workshop style) in linguistics and language development. Mother tongue Multi-lingual educational programs. Minority language literacy (both integrated with national educational programs, and community sponsored programs, for children and adults). NGOs and development agencies. Innovative computer technology development related to non-English typesetting and computing. Innovative creative access power solutions (like solar). Sustainable logistical support for difficult to access project locations (usually via air).    SIL has historically had a very fractured internal identity, and a very decentralized governance, which has not required a high degree of uniformity throughout the organization. Digital infrastructure projects stress these social norms.\n  Within the organization web-presence has come to be regarded as the officiating act recognition of an internal group\u0026rsquo;s merit.\n  Different people within the organization have strong opinions about how the world should view the organization — which are reflected in what they think the organization should say about itself — including the interactions that the organization provides to the people who interact on its website.\n  Globally, the Internet is going mobile, and SIL struggles between generating the informatic thrill need to entice donors, visual storytelling needed to facilitate product distribution and training needs of its product users, and high level information needs of politicians, and staffs of other NGOs to seed future partnerships.\n  Quantitatively, most people come to SIL.org to learn about linguistics, or the plethora of digital tools that SIL distributes via sil.org, or the vast number of resources .\n","date":1414022400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1414022400,"objectID":"c3987ebda60cde530b08e1362a559e67","permalink":"https://hughandbecky.us/Hugh-CV/project/2013-sil-org/","publishdate":"2014-10-23T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/Hugh-CV/project/2013-sil-org/","section":"project","summary":"Worked with a team to bring modern features via Drupal 7 to the flagship website of SIL International.","tags":["Architecture","UX","Business","Web-design"],"title":"User Experience Consulting on SIL.org","type":"project"},{"authors":["Hugh Paterson III"],"categories":null,"content":"Referenceable as:\nHugh J.

This paper explores keyboard design issues involved in designing two keyboards for two different established orthographies. Both orthographies are based on Latin scripts and cover a total of five minority languages in Mexico (four languages in the Meꞌphaa genus and Sochiapam Chinantec [cso] ). The design issues consider:\n\n1. Technical differences encountered across major computer operating systems (OS X and Windows)\n\n2. Computer culture issues like the keyboard layout of the national language\n\n3. Key stroke frequency of language specific segments\n\n4. Unicode/non-Unicode issues related to character composition\n\nDesigning a Unicode keyboard for data input allowed native speakers of Meꞌphaa to have a greater involvement in the data collected by feeding the documentation team typed data and texts in addition to providing oral data. Early adaption of digital input methods may prove to better meet the needs of both language community and researcher.

However, to understand this term, and its usage I think it is important to understand another term used prior to the rice farmer — The Ordinary Working Linguist. This older phrase has gained some traction as evidenced by its adoption in the linguistic literature1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.\nThe OWL or \u0026lsquo;ordinary working linguist\u0026rsquo; is attributed by George Lakoff to Charles Fillmore as a self-describing term. Though it is impossible to say if Fillmore actually coined the term. If he did then it is an interesting frame by the discoverer of cognitive framing. I have yet to meet an ordinary linguist. I have met smart linguists, extraordinary linguists, novel linguists, quirky linguists, geeky linguists, and ornery linguists — but never an ordinary one. The second issue I take with this contrived frame is that it suggest that somewhere there might be a non-working linguist. Now, either I have never met a lazy linguist, or I have been foiled by some collective endeavor. That is, the linguists I have met have somehow all decided that I am an extremely boring person — the kind to be avoided, and all have feign busyness! Granted busyness is not the same as \u0026ldquo;working\u0026rdquo; but I have never met a linguist who is not engaged in some sort of activity which has a mistakable similitude to work!\nAll the same, the notion of \u0026ldquo;OWL\u0026rdquo; seems to be very useful to a large group of linguists. For instance, Gary F. Simons suggests that Helen Aristar Dry proposed a book in the early 1990s with the title Computers and the Ordinary Working Linguist.9, While David Nathan, Peter Austin, Andrew Black, Piotr Bański, Mike Cahill, Jeff Good, Steven Moran, Scott Farrar, and René van den Berg all use the term in their works.\nIn honor of Fillmore, if we take a framing view of the phrase \u0026ldquo;ordinary working linguist\u0026rdquo; we can see that many of the authors are discussing the concept within the frame of linguistic computing — the computer tools that linguists use to do their work. However, it can be argued that there is an SIL specific shift in the framing of the phrase (usage by Cahill, Schroeder, Simons, Black, and van den Berg). Van den Berg\u0026rsquo;s use is most articulate:\n the typical SIL fieldworker is what has been called an ‘owl’, that is, an ‘ordinary working linguist’ who has been given enough training to enable him or her to do the job; this is usually a minimum of two semesters of field linguistics at graduate level. A typical SIL field worker is therefore very much a generalist, without specialist knowledge in any branch of linguistics.\n Van den Berg\u0026rsquo;s usage is both confirmed and then contrasted by SIL International on its website where it contrasts the term with Linguistics Coordinators, Linguistics Consultants, and International Linguistics Advisors. It is clear to see that within the shared frame by SIL staff, that Linguistic Consultants are those who have more training than typical SIL field workers. For several reasons, including reduced staffing, and paradigm shifts within project management related moral ownership within the tasks of language development, SIL has moved from ex-pat driven projects to nationally staffed and ethnolinguistic community driven projects. SIL\u0026rsquo;s minimally trained \u0026ldquo;OWLs\u0026rdquo; moved up the organizational chart to become project managers/facilitators, leaving open the \u0026ldquo;bottom\u0026rdquo; of the chart, ergo the new need for \u0026lsquo;rice farmer\u0026rsquo; as a newly perceived class of computer user.\nI find the term rice farmer 14 times in the internal SIL International wiki and I find \u0026ldquo;OWL\u0026rdquo; 83 times. These terms surface mostly among SIL computer app developers, but I also hear them used by SIL policy and procedures developers, SIL program planners, and SIL educators. To me this term comes off as a class distinction term (and maybe there is nothing wrong with class distinction; I mean the Jews had class distinctions at the time of Jesus, the Cretans had classes at the time of Titus, the British have it, and castes are alive and well in India, etc.10). However, as I find the term being used in SIL, a more transparent term might be \u0026lsquo;low socio-economic and low educational capacity individual\u0026rsquo;.\nThe problem is that in my work with Steve Marlett in Mexico, I worked with ethnolinguistic moronity language users who were not \u0026lsquo;low educational capacity individuals\u0026rsquo; rather they were high educational capacity individuals. When I went to Malaysia and worked with Sean Conklin, the same thing, ethnolinguistic minority language users were not low educational capacity individuals. When I went to Nigeria and worked with people like Becky Paterson and David Rowbory, the people doing language work with us were not low educational capacity individuals. In fact the Nigerian rice farmer/pastor/student/translator/cultural guide/language activist who was on our language project team can and does use ELAN after some training (and uses Facebook without training to boot — FYI: I need training on ELAN too!). So, why then do SIL staff use terms like \u0026lsquo;rice farmers\u0026rsquo; when they talk about designing software for users? Something seems to be wrong with this picture. My guess is that there is a real reason why SIL staff use the term, but it is not the reason that SIL staff attribute as the causation of the observation of \u0026ldquo;low educational capacity individuals\u0026rdquo; - as we observe dark skinned colleagues who try and use SIL software and don\u0026rsquo;t intuitively know how to use the tools. My guess is that the reason for the use of the term is because it is part of the SIL corporate ethos. SIL staff use (or at least have in the past) their educational courses at various SIL training events as filters to find the \u0026lsquo;best and brightest students\u0026rsquo; and recommend those for various field service within SIL. Then in the advanced classes SIL staff obfuscate the materials just to make them harder, to see if those same students are able to still keep up. So, as I see it, there seems to be this undefined class difference in SIL\u0026rsquo;s corporate sociology preferring those who can distill obfuscated communications under stress and dis-preferring those who cannot distill obfuscated signals under stress.\nSo for the following four reasons I strongly dis-prefer the terms \u0026lsquo;rice farmer\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;OWL\u0026rsquo; as they often appear in SIL discourse:\n I don\u0026rsquo;t think the \u0026lsquo;rice farmer\u0026rsquo; terminology is actually very useful for professional reasons. Software design is about communicating. It is about communicating relational concepts in a visual context. It is about connecting new analogies with salient concepts. User Interface (UI - what a software user sees and interacts with) is the gateway to User Experience (UX - the emotional, logical, task based context of activities that are attempting to be facilitated by the software designer and accomplished by the software user). Therefore what UX is really about is communicating ideas and creating positive and successful interactions. If the UI fails to create the designed UX then it doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter if the user is a rice farmer or a Ph.D. candidate from an Australian university. The end result is that the user is frustrated and will not use the software willingly. Therefore, singling out the \u0026lsquo;rice farmer\u0026rsquo; from the white guy is not really a useful construct because all users, whether black, white, tan, farmer, or stockbroker, are subject to the same constraints and frustrations of software which is not intuitively implemented. It is my experience that programmers (not just SIL programmers) usually do not intuitively know how application users think or behave. UX design is an art and a science that takes experimentation and a solid grasp of information design principles. Let\u0026rsquo;s not forget that, at least in software design we are talking about the \u0026lsquo;rice farmer\u0026rsquo; with a computer, an iPad, or an android device. We never use the American Corn Farmer, or the Norwegian Reindeer Rancher as analogies, and I am a bit tired of singling out people from tropical areas because their skin is darker, or their average height is shorter, or because they grow rice in their backyard. The focus on the \u0026lsquo;rice farmer\u0026rsquo; does not help us deal with the white guy\u0026rsquo;s problem with the software and robs us of a balanced view of the real communication challenge. Using the term \u0026lsquo;rice farmer\u0026rsquo; seems to put the ethnolinguistic minority language users and nationals in a sub-standard class relative to \u0026lsquo;real linguists\u0026rsquo; or \u0026lsquo;real missionaries\u0026rsquo;. Yes, my African colleagues who do have their own farms and families, also use SIL software; I first drove a tractor at age 13 and grew up on a farm, so what is the difference? By making the \u0026lsquo;OWL\u0026rsquo; or the \u0026lsquo;rice farmer\u0026rsquo; as some uninitiated or limited capacity person, the \u0026ldquo;reason\u0026rdquo; for new design (i.e the reason that WeSay was created to work with FLEx) doesn\u0026rsquo;t solve the fact that even for highly-educated-white-professionals FLEx is still confusing. The issue is a communications issue not a smarts or intelligence issue. Linguistic concepts can be communicated about beautifully and communicated simply, both in the classroom and in software.  I hope this post motivates those in SIL to take a deeper look at User Experience issues in the software tools and websites we build.\n  Bański, Piotr. 2010.

March 2014 Andreas Joswig asked a provocative question on the Linguistics Discussion List about the qualifications of .mp3 audio formats.  I quote our previous email correspondence here for context, and my final response which I hope is more informative than divisive. There were a lot of in between interactions between various members of the LDL including Ken Olson and J. Albert Bickford. The in between messages really shaped the conversation, and can be looked at through the archives of the LDL (contact the list admin for how to do that). They are not replicated here yet do to length. \n\n The purpose of this blog post is to record my final reply in a broader context than the LDL. There are several different groups in SIL operations who use audio, and there is no real position statement by the SIL Language and Culture Archive on what is the position or best practice of the Audio Archiving Industry, or the Cultural Heritage Archiving industry is with respect to audio formats. There is also no statement from the SIL Linguistics or Language Documentation Domains on the service standards SIL will strive to abide by when their staff is involved in language documentation projects. It is my goal here to provide as much connection to relevant literature as possible. My reply to Andreas will also be sent out on the LDL on or around 20. March 2014. However, the conversation may continue here, in the comments. Some comments may be incorporated into this post (i.e. if relevant literature is cited, that literature might also be incorporated into the relevant discussion section). If comments are sufficiently incorporated then they may be deleted, to keep the page clean. \n\n Perhaps some intense interest here, and some appropriate follow-up action might produce an educational touch point on the SIL public website about Audio formats, and the rationale behind it, so that SIL's position can be made clear to both internal audiences and external audiences.","tags":["Audio","Language Documentation","Filed work"],"title":"Audio File Formats - A follow up to the SIL internal conversation on the Linguistics Discussion List","type":"manuscripts"},{"authors":["Hugh Paterson III","Jeremy Nordmoe"],"categories":null,"content":"   Referenceable as:\nHugh J.

Along with that instance of DSpace, it also launched a software application (RAMP) which allows users to bundle electronic resources with the associated metadata for submission to DSpace (Nordmoe 2011). As the archive has deployed and supported this software it has encountered several ongoing challenges. This paper focuses on three factors which are affecting the success and use of RAMP. Broadly, these include: \n\n * User expectations - the metadata schema remains too complex for some usersʼ preference.\n\n* Organizational implementation - the failure of some parts of the institution to deploy the software.\n\n* User adoption - during the first 18 months approximately 15% of staff have routinely archived data through RAMP.\n\nIn todayʼs digital environment, interactions and their resulting success or failure to achieve specific business goals are ever more dependent on the user experience design. User Experience starts before the user has contact with the software but continues through the use cycle of that software to include issues like the infrastructure available for software support and the pleasure derived by the software user during use.\n\nRAMP is designed to facilitate the accession of items and to assist the archivist in identifying the items submitted by linguists. In its current design RAMP is heavily biased in solving the archivistʼs problems related to the organization of archived language materials. For the linguist, this means learning the archivistʼs terminology and learning how to work a tool designed from an archivist perspective. For successful communication between archivists and linguists to occur, these issues must be addressed through user experience design.","tags":["Archive"],"title":"Challenges of implementing a tool to extract metadata from linguists: the use case of RAMP","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Hugh Paterson III"],"categories":["Conference"],"content":"   A look a the types of orthographies being compared A.

This paper explores keyboard design issues involved in designing two keyboards for two different established orthographies. Both orthographies are based on Latin scripts and cover a total of five minority languages in Mexico (four languages in the Meꞌphaa genus and Sochiapam Chinantec [[cso](https://iso639-3.sil.org/code/cso)] ). The design issues consider: \n\n 1. Technical differences encountered across major computer operating systems (OS X and Windows). \n\n 2. Computer culture issues like the keyboard layout of the national language. \n\n 3. Key stroke frequency of language specific segments. \n\n 4. Unicode/non-Unicode issues related to character composition.\n\n  Designing a Unicode keyboard for data input allowed native speakers of Meꞌphaa to have a greater involvement in the data collected by feeding the documentation team typed data and texts in addition to providing oral data. Early adaption of digital input methods may prove to better meet the needs of both language community and researcher. By giving the language community a keyboard for their orthography the minority language speakers were given the opportunity to enter into, and use, new technological domains with their language.","tags":["Text Input"],"title":"Keyboard layout as part of language documentation: the case of the Me'phaa and Chinantec keyboards","type":"talk"},{"authors":null,"categories":["User Experience","Text Input"],"content":"This project formalized my interest in the text input problem. While doing text input for the Meꞌphaa language documentation project it was imperative to get Unicode encoded texts. I worked with Kevin Cline to create OS X and native Windows OS keyboards for Meꞌphaa writers. We used Ukelele to create the OS X keyboards and Microsoft Keyboard Layout Creator (MSKLC) to create the Windows keyboards.\nUpon hearing of my new found skills, language users from the Sochiapam Chinantec community asked me to make an OS X keyboard for their language. In both cases existing keyboard layouts were matched to synchronize the user experience across the OSes.\nSome of the design choices in the original layouts did not make sense to me. Hence the birth of the The minority language typing experience project.\n","date":1331510400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1331510400,"objectID":"50f551419e711e37e4744b824b29a08b","permalink":"https://hughandbecky.us/Hugh-CV/project/2011-mexico-keyboards/","publishdate":"2012-03-12T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/Hugh-CV/project/2011-mexico-keyboards/","section":"project","summary":"Revolutionizing text input.

In this paper, we document the articulation of the sound, providing acoustic and video data from Kagayanen and Limos Kalinga, respectively. The sound is attested in at least fifteen languages. It is contrastive in five Western Australian languages, while in the Philippines it generally patterns as an allophone of /l/ but has emerged recently as a separate phoneme due to contact. It arose independently in the two regions. The sound is easily describable in terms of values of phonological features or phonetic parameters. All of these factors argue for the inclusion of the sound in the International Phonetic Alphabet.","tags":["Interdental approximant","International Phonetic Alphabet"],"title":"The phonetic status of the (inter)dental approximant","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Hugh Paterson III","Steve Marlett","John Clifton"],"categories":["Colloquium"],"content":"","date":1248998412,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1248998412,"objectID":"1486bb3d452b5744a2be6bf9f74d7aea","permalink":"https://hughandbecky.us/Hugh-CV/talk/2009-lasting-linguistics-linguistics-leaving-mark/","publishdate":"2009-07-28T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/Hugh-CV/talk/2009-lasting-linguistics-linguistics-leaving-mark/","section":"talk","summary":"This was three mini-presentations on language documentation.","tags":["Preservation Studies"],"title":"Lasting linguistics: Making a meaningful mark","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Hugh Paterson III","Kenneth S Olson"],"categories":["Conference"],"content":"Bibliography for Abstract:  Olson, Kenneth S. \u0026amp; Jeff Mielke. 2007.

It is the goal of this paper to demonstrate how the (inter)dental approximant compares with the claimed phonemic inventory of Proto-Austronesian and to give a possible explanation for the variety of reflexes of *l seen in the Philippine Languages2 (PL). The suggestions in this paper for the phonetic value of *l are based on phonetic detail of the (inter)dental approximant described by Olson and Mielke (2007) and other descriptions from Philippine Languages.\n\n In historical linguistics our assumptions about a proto-language’s phoneme inventory are limited by our understanding of the phoneme inventory of the daughter languages. Without the right observations on the daughter languages, we are liable to make invalid conclusions about their proto forms. There has been a lack of attention given to the phonemic status of the (inter)dental approximant because of its categorization as an allophone of [l] or in the cases of its reflexes with [r]. This oversight has affected the perceived options available in the reconstruction of the phoneme inventory of PAn.","tags":["Interdental approximant","Historical Linguistics"],"title":"An unlikely retention","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Hugh Paterson III","Kenneth S Olson"],"categories":["Colloquium"],"content":"","date":1242705072,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1242705072,"objectID":"73bfeb19826000fdb7533177a43cdcbf","permalink":"https://hughandbecky.us/Hugh-CV/talk/2009-repair-strategies-interdental-gial/","publishdate":"2009-05-18T12:15:12-07:00","relpermalink":"/Hugh-CV/talk/2009-repair-strategies-interdental-gial/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":["Interdental approximant","Historical Linguistics"],"title":"Repair strategies used with the interdental approximant in some Philippine languages","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Hugh Paterson III"],"categories":["Descriptive Phonetics"],"content":"This research project was spearheaded by Ken Olson.

Rüdiger Köppe Verlag: Köln  Follow-up work:\nIt seems that the interdental approximant [ð̞] in Austronesian languages should challenge linguists in three important areas and thus deserves more thought and perhaps application in our theories. These categories are:\n The phonological status and interactions that happen with the segment. The phonetic contrast of the segment. The Historical status of the segment and the impact of its recognition in the Austronesian historical linguistic narrative.  Publications to date have focused on two relevant aspects of the interdental approximant:\n ð̞ is important in descriptive linguistics. ð̞ is different phonetically from other described segments.  The following remain to be shown clearly in appropriate publications.\nPhonetic contrast\n What is the duration of the sound and what are the boarders? Measure the stable section? Where does it stop and where does it begin? What is the acoustical (in terms of both production and perception) difference between /l/ and /ð̞ /?  The ulturasound study does provide a good starting point to answer these questions.\n  ð̞ it has a unique spectrograph when compared with other liquids, vowels, and interdentals - especially within the same language.\n  ð̞ is different from the native sounds of { l, a, ɐ, n, ʔ, d, g, r, s, h, x} which occur in Philippine languages.\n This has been done in small phonology descriptions but not full scale acoustically reference-able phonetic descriptions across the entire set of languages discussed in the JIPA article.    ð̞ is different from the borrowed sounds of { l, a, ɐ, n, ʔ, d, g, θ, ð, r, s, h, x, ɣ}\n  In terms of psycholinguistics the question remains,: What are the unique properties of this sound as they are culturally defined? or to put this another way: What are the acustic cues, what are the visual cues, and what are the cultural constraints that those cues may violate?\n  My research position suggests that there has been change. Change involves a variety of cognitive processes. Re-analysis is one such process. If I hypothesize that re-analysis has occurred, then what is the Cognitive load of this segment? How has that load shifted or why can it shift?\n  What are the unique properties that users attribute to this segment as cross-linguistically defined (but keeping within Austronesian or the Austro-Tai hypotheses).\n  What are those unique properties as Universally or empirically defined?\n  Historical Narrative\n  There is an open question with relationship to historical Austronesian as to what the metrical structure of the language was. If we posit some change in the metical structrue what relevance does that have on the interdental approximant? Does the concept of Phonetic Gemination apply?\n  In some theories of Austro-Tai there is some relevance to constructing suprasegmental features and genisis or de-genesis processes for these features. In that contexts: Is it possible that ð̞ is a tone bearing unit? (TBU).\n  Interdental is contrastive with dental in Place in the IPA Chart ð̞ is important to PAn Historical Phonology Theory\n  ð̞ is related to several mergers and splits\n  ð̞ is PAn *R\n  ð̞ Shows that [+Nasal], historically, is, or is/and a super-segmental feature in Austronesian languages.\n  ð̞ shows that there are fewer proto-phonemes than necessary in current models of PAn.\n  ð̞ helps us to understand the PAn foot.\n  ð̞ was represented in the baybin original orthography.\n  ð̞ is relevant enough to be represented consistently in orthographies in the languages it occurs in.\nPhonology\nThere are several open phonological questions. Some of these have answers in the cited materials, but the data is not always clear for all languages which also have interdental approximants.\n  What are the claimed Phonemes of kangayen?\n  It would be all the more the claim that ð̞ is phonemic not due to a split. If it is a retention then this perspective has more weight.\n  What is the ð̞ pattern concerning natural classes.\n  In a feature geometry perspective, what features does ð̞ have.\n  Some Austornesian language have Metathesis. Is this metathesis process triggered in any way by the ð̞?\n  ð̞ has moraic value - what is it?\n  What is the affect of ð̞ on vowel quality?\n  In what ways can we measure the impact that ð̞ has on cognitive load?\n  Does the ð̞ occur in multiple areas of the lexicon\n  To do this a survey of the texts should be used to evaluated the location of ð̞ in the lexicon.
