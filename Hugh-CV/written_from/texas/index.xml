      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have been working on describing the &lt;a href=&#34;http://fieldworks.sil.org/flex/&#34; title=&#34;FLEx&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;FLEx&lt;/a&gt; software eco-system (for both a blog post and an info-graphic). In the process I googled 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.google.com/search?q=%22language&amp;#43;documentation%22&amp;#43;workflow%22&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Language documentation workflow&lt;/a&gt; and was promptly directed to resources created for InField and aggregated via &lt;a href=&#34;http://web.archive.org/web/20130715000000*/http://www.ctldc.org/&#34; title=&#34;Consortium on Training in Language Documentation and Conservation&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;ctldc.org&lt;/a&gt;. For example, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ctldc.org/clearing-house/item/65-principles-and-multimedia-tools-for-sustainable-language-documentation-maintenance-and-revitalization&#34;&gt;http://www.ctldc.org/clearing-house/item/65-principles-and-multimedia-tools-for-sustainable-language-documentation-maintenance-and-revitalization&lt;/a&gt; An amazing set of resources. the ctldc.org website is well put together and the content from 
&lt;a href=&#34;http://web.archive.org/web/20130117034354/http://logos.uoregon.edu/infield2010/workshops/tools-for-language/index.php&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;InField 2010&lt;/a&gt; and 2008 is amazing - I wish I could have been there. They incorporate new technologies and methods in ways that SIL fieldwork programs do not attempt to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;rsquo;t imagine that there is a very large student base for these kinds of summer schools (competency exchanges). Therefore, I am almost convinced that most SIL staff pursuing linguistic fieldwork should just go to InField&amp;hellip; To do that effectivly, SIL would need to provide teachers and content to these various summer training programs. It means that SIL would need to organize itself more modularly around the course, rather than around the course-set or program. On the other hand, it is true that InField seems to be targeted at someone who has had more than one semester of linguistics training. SIL schools seem to be constructed at taking someone with zero linguistic background.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Language and Culture Documentation vs. Cultural Digital Natives</title>
      <link>https://hughandbecky.us/Hugh-CV/post/language-and-culture-documentation-vs-cultural-digital-natives/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 12 Jun 2012 14:16:50 -0700</pubDate>
      <guid>https://hughandbecky.us/Hugh-CV/post/language-and-culture-documentation-vs-cultural-digital-natives/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I feel that in the language and culture documentation community that there is a tension between &amp;ldquo;documenting&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;globalizing&amp;rdquo;. In the sense that what we as digital natives and cultural technologists think is &amp;ldquo;living&amp;rdquo; is in part &amp;ldquo;documenting&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, in some sense &amp;ldquo;Language Documentation&amp;rdquo; is an academic pursuit of its own right independent of linguistics if it has a plan and tries to capture elements of the expression of the culture and language as it is spoken or acted out. I think there is a bit of confusion in the literature as linguists move from linguistics to language development and community development. This is particularly evident with the use of video in language documentation. Granted, there is a great deal of variance in the use of video for language documentation. But add to the language documentation movement&amp;rsquo;s zeal, a dose of &lt;em&gt;empowerment ideology&lt;/em&gt; and we come up with what seems like &amp;ldquo;let&amp;rsquo;s give everyone in the town/village a voice recorder and a video camera and tell them to document their language and culture how they want to&amp;rdquo;. So, I wonder is that really any different than what digital natives are doing in cultures where there is a high degree of digital penetration? &lt;em&gt;Is this really &lt;strong&gt;language documentation&lt;/strong&gt; or is this really &lt;strong&gt;evangelism of a global digital culture&lt;/strong&gt;?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think the following video, &lt;em&gt;Look at this Instagram (Nickelback Parody)&lt;/em&gt; by College Humor (text reproduced below), points out how &amp;ldquo;language and culture documentation&amp;rdquo; is already occurring in cultures where there is a high degree of digital object penetration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;iframe src=&#34;https://player.vimeo.com/video/86627804&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;&#34; title=&#34;vimeo video&#34; webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where there is a high degree of digital object penetration the digital objects are bound to change the culture and the cultural diversity at a global scale&amp;hellip; (If everyone in the world has an iPhone then&amp;hellip; there is some commonality in user experience and in connecting with that object.) So, in a sense the introduction of the digital element does change the culture; not that cultures have not been changed throughout history by inventions, but with inventions come attitudes and behavioral responses to those inventions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, give someone in a community a video camera and a YouTube account and you might get something like the following video. But that does not mean that it is language and culture documentation - or does it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Look at this Instagram (Nickelback Parody)
Written by Dan Gurewitch &amp; Owen Parsons
GUY:
Look at this Instagram
Eggs benedict, side of ham
(flipping to a new photo)
Started out as a lemon tart
Then my phone went and made it art
&lt;p&gt;GIRL:
(photo of her intricately-painted fingernails)
And these are my fingernails
The beauty is in the details
(photo of girl holding cocktail; also pushing boobs together with close arms)
Drinkin mai-tais on a cruise
Just a coincidence it&amp;rsquo;s also boobs&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GUY
(photo of own feet while lying on the beach)
Everyone look at my feet
Get jealous that I&amp;rsquo;m at the beach
You prob&amp;rsquo;ly knew I was going there
You saw my plane&amp;rsquo;s wing in the air
(photo of plane&amp;rsquo;s wing from inside the plane)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GIRL
(photo of tall skyscrapers from the ground)
Are you bored of city lights?
Try seein&amp;rsquo; &amp;lsquo;em in black and white
(same photo in black and white)
Puttin&amp;rsquo; glasses on a cat
I&amp;rsquo;m the first one to think of that!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, oh, oh… He thinks he&amp;rsquo;s people&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CHORUS (GUY &amp;amp; GIRL):
Every time I take a photo of an old door,
Every sign out in front of an abandoned store
It&amp;rsquo;s such a thrill to add a filter
Lo-fi, lo-fi&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every time a thing reminds me of a penis
(photo of a phallic object)
Every fortune cookie fortune that I&amp;rsquo;ve ever seen is
on my feed, it&amp;rsquo;s guaranteed with
five likes, five likes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GUY
Look at this coffee foam
Now look at this pretentious tome
(photo of the cover of Infinite Jest)
Now look at this garden gnome
I&amp;rsquo;m friggin&amp;rsquo; Michaelangelo!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GIRL
Fireworks in the sky
A super close-up of my eye
Now a selfie, lookin&amp;rsquo; cute
In the same room where I poop
(photo: the classic bathroom mirror self-shot)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GUY
Sometimes I just wanna browse
A hundred thousand pics of clouds
(distracted by a nearby waddling duck, he chases it, holding his phone out)
Hang on, I need to get this duck
Hold still, goddamn it, f**k!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, oh, no
It&amp;rsquo;s all blurry&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CHORUS 2 (GUY &amp;amp; GIRL):
No you haven&amp;rsquo;t really ever seen a setting sun
&amp;lsquo;Til you&amp;rsquo;ve seen it on the screen where you play Temple Run
I&amp;rsquo;m so hell-bent on documentin&amp;rsquo;
Peach pie, peach pie&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think it&amp;rsquo;s bad now, wait until I&amp;rsquo;m 33
So many pictures of my kids you&amp;rsquo;ll want to murder me
(fumbling with the camera while his child walks in background)
Missed their first steps &amp;lsquo;cause I&amp;rsquo;m obsessed with
Red-eye, red-eye!&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;!--(( M. Paul Lewis. (ed.), 2009. Ethnologue: Languages of the World, 16th Edn. Dallas, Tex.: SIL International. )) --&gt;as an academic book, is somewhat of a straw man in linguistics.

These efforts seeking funding are usually an effort to get more language data. The rationale for this is two fold:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Because so little is known that we do not know if the Ethnologue is correct.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Because there is a conflict between other published sources and the Ethnologue (( Roger Blench. n.d. Introduction to the Temein languages &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.rogerblench.info/Language/Nilo-Saharan/Eastern%20Sudanic/Temein%20cluster/Blench%20Temein%20language%20NM%20proceedings.pdf&#34;&gt;http://www.rogerblench.info/Language/Nilo-Saharan/Eastern%20Sudanic/Temein%20cluster/Blench%20Temein%20language%20NM%20proceedings.pdf&lt;/a&gt; [&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.rogerblench.info/Language/Nilo-Saharan/Eastern%20Sudanic/Temein%20cluster/Blench%20Temein%20language%20NM%20proceedings.pdf&#34; title=&#34;PDF - Does Roger ever professionally publish? Somebody give that man a lesson on how to make web friendly URLs and file names.&#34;&gt;PDF&lt;/a&gt;] [Accessed: 15 February 2011] )) .&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In both cases the Ethnologue is not taken as an authoritative and accurate source (in an earnest sense, but certainly a citable source (( Lyle Campbell, and Verónica Grondona. 2008. Review of &lt;em&gt;Ethnologue: Languages of the world&lt;/em&gt;. 15th ed. Ed. by Raymond G. Gordon, JR. Dallas: SIL International, 2005. Pp. 1,272. ISBN 155671159X. $80(Hb).

In some of the courses at the graduate level linguistics program I am in, citing the data from the Ethnologue is &lt;em&gt;verboten&lt;/em&gt;. It is not that the Ethnologue is only cited by grant writers or in reference to language documentation efforts. It is cited by many others like: 	&lt;ul&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, it is this perspective on the Ethnologue where, academics cite it, and then use the citation in a manner to justify proving it (the Ethnologue) wrong or inaccurate which makes me say that it is perceived as a straw man. The Ethnologue has a long history (( Marie Lebert. 25 July 2011. eBooks: 2009 – 6,909 living languages in the Ethnologue. &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.gutenbergnews.org/20110725/ebooks-2009-6909-living-languages-in-the-ethnologue/&#34;&gt;http://www.gutenbergnews.org/20110725/ebooks-2009-6909-living-languages-in-the-ethnologue/&lt;/a&gt; [&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.gutenbergnews.org/20110725/ebooks-2009-6909-living-languages-in-the-ethnologue/&#34; title=&#34;2009 – 6,909 living languages in the Ethnologue&#34;&gt;Link&lt;/a&gt;] [Accessed: 15 February 2011] )) . Both Simons and Campbell point out the Ethnologue did not start out as a linguistics publication. The book was not always published by SIL International, it was formerly published by Wycliffe Bible Translators (( Barbara F. Grimes. (Ed.), 1984. Ethnologue: languages of the world, 10th Edn. Dallas, Tex.: Wycliffe Bible Translators. )) . It is interesting how, a &amp;ldquo;non-academic&amp;rdquo; book has such weight in academia and though some despise its origin (( Ole Stig Andersen. 20 June 2005. A Language is a dialect with a missionary. &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.olestig.dk/reviews/ethnologue.html&#34;&gt;http://www.olestig.dk/reviews/ethnologue.html&lt;/a&gt; [&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.olestig.dk/reviews/ethnologue.html&#34; title=&#34;Link&#34;&gt;Link&lt;/a&gt;] )) it is still a highly cited resource.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the Ethnologue does not cited its language tree associations or where it gets it data in its entries.&lt;ref&gt;And since 15th Edn. of the Ethnologue (( Raymond G. Gordon, JR. (ed.), 2005. Ethnologue: Languages of the World, 15th Edn. Dallas, Tex.: SIL International. ))  where it adopted the ISO 639-3 when people today dispute the Ethnologue as conflating or inflating languages perhaps these researchers should be interacting with the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.sil.org/iso639-3/&#34; title=&#34;ISO 639-3 Registrar&#34;&gt;ISO 639-3 registrar&lt;/a&gt; rather than disputing the Ethnologue.&lt;/ref&gt; It does have citations for the intro to the book but not for the presentation of material under each language. This is uncommon for Language Atlases and Language Reference books. WALS (( Matthew S. Dryer &amp;amp; Martin Haspelmath (eds.). 2011. The World Atlas of Language Structures Online.

In terms of academic merit, the Ethnologue does leave itself open to criticism. While it is understandable that some details might be left out for the sake of printing a hardbound copy. There is no excuse for not providing this data to the viewers of the entries on-line or in non-paper mediums. Just because the Ethnologue is open to criticism in this way does not mean that it is not edited in earnest or an award winning publication (( Collins Maps. 25 June 2010. The BCS John C. Bartholomew Award 2010 Winner. &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.collinsmaps.com/2010/06/bcs-john-c-bartholomew-award-2010.html&#34;&gt;http://blog.collinsmaps.com/2010/06/bcs-john-c-bartholomew-award-2010.html&lt;/a&gt; .

Commended by the bestower s of the John C Bartholomew Award&lt;/em&gt; )) . As a publication it looks to enhance its coverage to include language vitality and EGIDS (( Paul M. Lewis &amp;amp; Gary F. Simons. 2010. Assessing endangerment: Expanding Fishman&amp;rsquo;s GIDS. Revue Roumaine de Linguistique 55.2: 103–20. )) metrics for the languages it lists (( Gary Simons. 2010. Ethnologue as a global sourcebook on linguistic diversity and language vitality. 12th International Congress of Ethnobiology Tofino, British Columbia, 9–14 May 2010. &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.sil.org/~simonsg/presentation/ICE%202010%20slides.pdf&#34;&gt;http://www.sil.org/~simonsg/presentation/ICE%202010%20slides.pdf&lt;/a&gt; [&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.sil.org/~simonsg/presentation/ICE%202010%20slides.pdf&#34; title=&#34;Includes a brief history of the Ethnologue &#34;&gt;PDF&lt;/a&gt;] [Accessed: 15 February 2012] )) . It is also my understanding that every editorial cycle there are multiple thousands of edits which occur and a great deal of effort goes into keeping the book accurate. However for an &lt;em&gt;end user&lt;/em&gt;, edits, enacted because of greater, more accurate knowledge about a reported language situation is not distinguished from edits based on corrections to errors. The question will then arise, &lt;em&gt;What was the purpose of the edit?&lt;/em&gt; was it mis-information before, or do we now just have a more accurate time sensitive snapshot?&lt;/p&gt;
