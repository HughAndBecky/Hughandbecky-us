      <description>Background of the paper OLAC is the Open Language Archive Community. This is a community of digital data collections which aggregate their holdings data to a common place so that linguists can view the data by a variety of parameters which are relevant to linguists. The two major parts of OLAC are the aggregator and a metadata standard. The metadata standard is OAI compliant and pairs well with Dublin Core.</description>
