      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is a short non-exhaustive bibliography of papers which discuss &lt;em&gt;Informed consent&lt;/em&gt; in the context of one of the following: minority language communities, low literacy levels, language research, the legal aspect of the US IRB, and &amp;lsquo;how informed is informed consent&amp;rsquo; . I have several nagging questions, which I wonder how discussed they are: &amp;ldquo;Is Intellectual property rights of minority language people covered in the typical informed consent protocols of language researchers?&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;How ethical is it to create voice-to-speech tools for a small language community when only one or two people provide voice samples?&amp;rdquo; When working independently, outside the confines of an organization these factors are not mitigated by institutional barriers to creativity or participant considerations.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
