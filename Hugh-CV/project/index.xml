      <title>U̠t-Ma&#39;in Lexicography</title>

      <description>This project includes combining and collating several U̠t-Ma&amp;rsquo;in databases that Becky Paterson has created over the 12 years she has worked with the U̠t-Ma&amp;rsquo;in language community. We are also importing as many Hausa terms as possible for specific elicitation (such as regional plants and animals). The final database includes grammatical features of individual lexemes. We are including various external analyses from phonology tools. None of this data is currently public. But when it is, a link from here will be posted.</description>

      <title>U̠t-Ma&#39;in oral history</title>

      <description>Becky received a grant to facilitate the collection of oral story data. The terms of the grant require her to record and archive oral histories of U̠t-Ma&amp;rsquo;in speakers. My role in this project was to work with U̠t-Ma&amp;rsquo;in speakers (who actually did the recordings themselves) and present these to the Becky in way that she could arrange the files for archiving. In my role I got to visit around 40 different places in 7 different dialects.</description>

      <title>SIL Communications Strategy Consulting</title>
      <link>http://hugh4.us/resume/project/2017-sil-ils-communications/</link>

      <guid>http://hugh4.us/resume/project/2017-sil-ils-communications/</guid>
      <description>This project is about creating a work environment where people are informed about the services and products that the organization is able to offer. It is about breaking down communication silos and working across corporate structures to create a unified workforce. I have the ongoing privilege of consulting with department heads and team leaders on interdepartmental communication and audience engagement strategies. Often this involves creative uses of technology and creating data management plans and publishing work flows.</description>

      <title>The minority language typing experience</title>
      <link>http://hugh4.us/resume/project/2014-typing-experience/</link>

      <guid>http://hugh4.us/resume/project/2014-typing-experience/</guid>
      <description>Previous work:
This project follows and builds upon the project where keyboard layouts for Meꞌphaa and Sochiapam Chinantec were produced. This project uses data from Meꞌphaa and Sochiapam Chinantec but purposely extends the scope of the analysis to include Latin and Cyrillic script languages, particularly focusing on those with diacritics which express tone.
Goals:
The goal of this project is to bring &amp;lsquo;natural&amp;rsquo;, intuitive, and easy to use typing experiences in the form of keyboard layout designs to minority language users.</description>

      <title>Meꞌphaa and Sochiapam Chinantec Keyboards</title>
      <link>http://hugh4.us/resume/project/2012-mexico-keyboards/</link>

      <guid>http://hugh4.us/resume/project/2012-mexico-keyboards/</guid>
      <description>This project formalized my interest in the text input problem. While doing text input for the Meꞌphaa language documentation project it was imperative to get Unicode encoded texts. I worked with Kevin Cline to create OS X and native Windows OS keyboards for Meꞌphaa writers. We used Ukelele to create the OS X keyboards and Microsoft Keyboard Layout Creator (MSKLC) to create the Windows keyboards.
Upon hearing of my new found skills, language users from the Sochiapam Chinantec community asked me to make an OS X keyboard for their language.</description>

      <title>Audio Digitization</title>

      <guid>http://hugh4.us/resume/project/2010-americas-area-audio-digitization/</guid>
      <description>This project involved the accession, cataloging and digitization of several collections. It also involved cataloging of multiple collections already accessioned but not yet cataloged. I was responsible for identifying and collecting metadata relevant for audio collections. I communicated with the SIL Language and Culture Archive staff when metadata schemas in place were insufficient for audio collections. I identified and recommended changes to metadata profiles used at the time by the Language and Culture Archives.</description>

      <description>I served as project manager, recruiting and supervising a volunteer workforce. Together we cataloged and scanned over 1000 photos.
We also repatriated some photos. We took old photo albums to reunions where former SIL staff identified persons and places in the images.</description>

      <guid>http://hugh4.us/resume/project/2010-americas-area-text-digitization/</guid>
      <description>I worked with the SIL Americas Area Access Coordinator to make language materials available to translators, researchers, and language development workers. There is a wealth of information that is simply inaccessible to those who could use it. I helped in the implementation of a system to make these materials available digitally, via the internet. Access to these materials affects the mechanics of language development and translation projects throughout the Americas Area and around the world.</description>

      <title>Interdental approximant</title>
      <link>http://hugh4.us/resume/project/2010-interdental-approximant/</link>

      <guid>http://hugh4.us/resume/project/2010-interdental-approximant/</guid>
      <description>This research project was spearheaded by Ken Olson. As a collaborator with him I focused on the Historical linguistics status of the interdental approximant in Philippine languages. I also did a lot of library resources discovery and acquisition.
In this project description I have listed more than my contribution because I am not sure there is anywhere else that has pulled together the combined research on this topic.
Results &amp;amp; Significance:</description>
