  {"id":"alpaslan-roodenberg_ethics_2021","abstract":"We are a group of archaeologists, anthropologists, curators and geneticists representing diverse global communities and 31 countries. All of us met in a virtual workshop dedicated to ethics in ancient DNA research held in November 2020. There was widespread agreement that globally applicable ethical guidelines are needed, but that recent recommendations grounded in discussion about research on human remains from North America are not always generalizable worldwide. Here we propose the following globally applicable guidelines, taking into consideration diverse contexts. These hold that: (1) researchers must ensure that all regulations were followed in the places where they work and from which the human remains derived; (2) researchers must prepare a detailed plan prior to beginning any study; (3) researchers must minimize damage to human remains; (4) researchers must ensure that data are made available following publication to allow critical re-examination of scientific findings; and (5) researchers must engage with other stakeholders from the beginning of a study and ensure respect and sensitivity to stakeholder perspectives. We commit to adhering to these guidelines and expect they will promote a high ethical standard in DNA research on human remains going forward.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,3,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Alpaslan-Roodenberg","given":"Songül"},{"family":"Anthony","given":"David"},{"family":"Babiker","given":"Hiba"},{"family":"Bánffy","given":"Eszter"},{"family":"Booth","given":"Thomas"},{"family":"Capone","given":"Patricia"},{"family":"Deshpande-Mukherjee","given":"Arati"},{"family":"Eisenmann","given":"Stefanie"},{"family":"Fehren-Schmitz","given":"Lars"},{"family":"Frachetti","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Fujita","given":"Ricardo"},{"family":"Frieman","given":"Catherine J."},{"family":"Fu","given":"Qiaomei"},{"family":"Gibbon","given":"Victoria"},{"family":"Haak","given":"Wolfgang"},{"family":"Hajdinjak","given":"Mateja"},{"family":"Hofmann","given":"Kerstin P."},{"family":"Holguin","given":"Brian"},{"family":"Inomata","given":"Takeshi"},{"family":"Kanzawa-Kiriyama","given":"Hideaki"},{"family":"Keegan","given":"William"},{"family":"Kelso","given":"Janet"},{"family":"Krause","given":"Johannes"},{"family":"Kumaresan","given":"Ganesan"},{"family":"Kusimba","given":"Chapurukha"},{"family":"Kusimba","given":"Sibel"},{"family":"Lalueza-Fox","given":"Carles"},{"family":"Llamas","given":"Bastien"},{"family":"MacEachern","given":"Scott"},{"family":"Mallick","given":"Swapan"},{"family":"Matsumura","given":"Hirofumi"},{"family":"Morales-Arce","given":"Ana Y."},{"family":"Matuzeviciute","given":"Giedre Motuzaite"},{"family":"Mushrif-Tripathy","given":"Veena"},{"family":"Nakatsuka","given":"Nathan"},{"family":"Nores","given":"Rodrigo"},{"family":"Ogola","given":"Christine"},{"family":"Okumura","given":"Mercedes"},{"family":"Patterson","given":"Nick"},{"family":"Pinhasi","given":"Ron"},{"family":"Prasad","given":"Samayamantri P.

The return of the skeletal remains of 21 individuals highlights the role that representative bodies — past and present, individual and organizational — play in engagements between the State and Aboriginal people. Heralded by some as a sincere sign of reconciliation and treated as suspect and misguided by others, the reburial produced diverse responses from both Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal people alike. Speakers at the repatriation focused on righting the wrongs of the past, reconciliation, and moving forward in cooperation, suggesting the redemptive significance of these events. Among Kooris at La Perouse, debates about community, representation, and belonging expose the ways that Aboriginal people and communities operate through, against, and beyond ‘whitefella’ structures of recognition to define who they are and what their culture is.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,3,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Lambert-Pennington","given":"Katherine"}],"citation-key":"lambert-pennington_what_2007","container-title":"Oceania","DOI":"10.1002/j.1834-4461.2007.tb00019.x","ISSN":"1834-4461","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2007]]},"language":"en","page":"313-336","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"What Remains?

  {"id":"ousley_federal_2005","abstract":"Two laws governing the disposition of Native American human remains in museums and institutions have had a profound impact on anthropology, and especially physical anthropology. In contrast to the perception of constant conflict between Native Americans and physical anthropologists, the repatriation process based on these laws has been in large part harmonious between institutions and Native peoples in the US. Despite misconceptions, the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (NAPGRA; 25 United States Code (U.S.C.) 3001-3013) was not intended to halt further research on Native American remains in museums. In fact, court decisions have affirmed that the documentation of human remains produces information no other methods can provide, and provides necessary evidence to be incorporated and weighed, along with other evidence, in evaluating “cultural affiliation,” the legal term for the required connection from federally recognized Native American groups to their ancestors. The wide variety of osteological data collected at the National Museum of Natural History (NMNH), Smithsonian Institution, have proven indispensable when evaluating cultural affiliation, especially when other information sources are unhelpful or ambiguous, and provide an empirical basis for determining the ancestry of individuals whose remains will be discovered in the future. To date, the claim-driven process at the NMNH has resulted in the affiliation and repatriation of more Native American remains than any other institution in the country. Repatriation experiences at the NMNH demonstrate the changing relationships between museums and Native peoples, the continuing important contributions that physical anthropology makes to the repatriation process, and the importance of physical anthropology in understanding the recent and ancient history of North America.

  {"id":"paterson_iii_olac_2022","abstract":"From the perspective of ethno-linguistic minority communities and those who work with them, finding pedagogical, descriptive, and primary documentation resources about their culture and language have never been easy. This has primarily been due to the lack of language-specific indexing of resources in libraries and\narchives. The Open Language Archive Community (OLAC) created a metadata profile and aggregator built upon Open Archive Initiative (OAI) protocol and Dublin Core Metadata Standard (DCMS) to address the lack of diversity in indexing language and culture resources. The aggregator supports discovery of resources\nwith language as an entry point into the discovery process. This application profile is used by over sixty data providers. In this paper I address the lack of inclusion of services as identified by the DCMIType \"Service\" within the aggregated records. I discuss services from a typological perspective and explore how services can themselves be language resources. I propose that indexing services, specifically language resource services, is one way to increase diversity in records while connecting language communities with digital resources they can use in their language.","author":[{"family":"Paterson III","given":"Hugh J"}],"citation-key":"paterson_iii_olac_2022","container-title":"Proceedings of DC-2022","event-place":"Online","event-title":"DC-2022","issued":{"date-parts":[[2022]]},"page":"Pre-print","publisher":"Dublin Core Metadata Initiative","publisher-place":"Online","title":"An OLAC Perspective on Services: The Forgotten Language Resources","type":"paper-conference","URL":"https://hughandbecky.us/Hugh-CV/talk/2022-services-the-forgotten-language-resources/DC_2022_Conference_Paper_Paterson_Revisions_pre-print.pdf"},

  {"id":"thornton_repatriation_2002","abstract":"On the morning of Friday, 9 October 1993, a small group of Northern Cheyenne\narrived at the Smithsonian Institution’s National Museum of Natural History. They\nhad come for their dead. Almost 115 years earlier, on 9 January 1879, at least\n83 members of Dull Knife’s (aka Morning Star) band of 149 Northern Cheyenne had\nbeen massacred by US Government soldiers near Fort Robinson, Nebraska, after a\nfinal, desperate attempt at freedom by the Cheyenne. They had fled toward their\nhomelands in Montana, after having been moved to a reservation in Oklahoma to live\nwith the Southern Cheyenne in 1877.They were captured, however; they were then\nheld in the stockade at Fort Robinson with little food, water or even heat. They\nattempted to escape after two weeks. At least 57 Northern Cheyenne were killed\nduring the escape; 32 others escaped but were trapped on 22 January at the edge of\nAntelope Creek: 26 of them were killed during the resulting massacre. Most of those\nkilled in the escape attempt were buried near the fort; those killed at Antelope Creek\nwere buried nearby in a mass grave.The bones of 17 of the Northern Cheyenne were\ncollected after their brutal deaths for scientific study by the US Army Medical\nExaminer. Nine of these were obtained from the mass grave at Antelope Creek which\nwas exhumed in 1880.The bones – mostly crania – had been later transferred to the\nSmithsonian’s National Museum of Natural History.The bones were from Cheyenne\nranging in age from 49 years old to a three-year-old child massacred at Antelope\nCreek. All were now being returned to their people in a joint repatriation with the\nPeabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology at Harvard which also had some\nskeletal remains from the Antelope Creek massacre, collected by a museum curator\nabout a month before those at the Army Medical Museum.","author":[{"family":"Thornton","given":"Russell"}],"citation-key":"thornton_repatriation_2002","container-title":"The Dead and their Possessions","ISBN":"978-0-203-16577-5","issued":{"date-parts":[[2002]]},"number-of-pages":"8","publisher":"Routledge","title":"Repatriation as healing the wounds of the trauma of history: cases of Native Americans in the United States of America","title-short":"Repatriation as healing the wounds of the trauma of history","type":"chapter"},
