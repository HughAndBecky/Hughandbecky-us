  {"id":"ackery_carcassons_1995","abstract":"The result of more than 20 years of research and collaboration by international butterfly experts, this book is the first comprehensive catalogue to the butterfly fauna of any major tropical region and, as such, provides a basic research tool for any worker with an interest in African butterflies. Covering 3593 recognised species in 300 genera, it deals with about 20% of the world butterfly fauna. Included are entries for all genus-group, species-group and infra-subspecific names applicable to the Afrotropical butterflies, a total of about 14 000 names.

  {"id":"bossart_book_2009","abstract":"Butterflies of West Africa by Torben Lasen is a monumental and exceptional work. This two volume set stands as the definitive taxonomic treatment currently existing for butterflies of western West Africa and will undoubtedly continue in this respect far into the future. Its publication has already had considerable impact judging by the plethora of recent interest and activity in the region. Dr. Larsen \" ...attempts to summarize all that is known about the nearly 1500 butterfly species known from West Africa, the fifteen countries that stretch from Senegal and Mau-ritania on the Atlantic to Nigeria and Niger in the east... \" and bordered by the Sahara Desert in the north. Included are the nearly 400 species that have been added to the checklist since Carcasson's African Butterflies (Ackery et al. 1995) and 18 newly described species. Over 10 years of research went into making this book, including substantial in-country field collecting, an exhaustive review of existing literature, broad-scale examination of materials in museums and private collections, and extensive consultation with those working within the region and discipline. The text volume provides a lucid, insightful introductory section that discusses evolution, biogeography, and conservation of West African butterflies and includes 12 informative data tables. The bulk of this 600 page volume consists of species accounts well-organized into subsections on identification, taxonomic notes, early stages, habits, and distributions. Illustrated identification aids are largely restricted to line drawings of genitalia for a number of difficult-to-identify species. This systematic section also includes a helpful gazetteer and glossary of technical terms, and an informative table of global range distributions for all Afrotropical genera. This table additionally summarizes the taxonomic framework used by the author. The newly described species and summary of Dr. Larsen's suggested taxonomic changes are added as Appendices. The plate volume consists of 125 full-color plates, each of which has a facing, cross-reference text page. Plates depict 3900 individual butterfly photos shown at actual size. Nearly all 1500 species are represented, the large majority by multiple photos that show dorsal and ventral views and sexual or seasonal polymorphism. The unique number assigned to each species allows for easy cross-referencing between the text and plate volumes. Both volumes end with an index of species names. The author has made a valiant effort to produce an authoritative taxonomic treatment that also could be used as an on-the-ground butterfly identification guide. The decision to split the material into separate text and plate volumes resulted from polling of likely users who thought two volumes would facilitate field activities.

  {"id":"habib_cost-effectiveness_2015","abstract":"Background Snakebite envenoming is a major public health problem throughout the rural tropics. Antivenom is effective in reducing mortality and remains the mainstay of therapy. This study aimed to determine the cost-effectiveness of using effective antivenoms for Snakebite envenoming in Nigeria. Methodology Economic analysis was conducted from a public healthcare system perspective. Estimates of model inputs were obtained from the literature. Incremental Cost Effectiveness Ratios (ICERs) were quantified as deaths and Disability-Adjusted-Life-Years (DALY) averted from antivenom therapy. A decision analytic model was developed and analyzed with the following model base-case parameter estimates: type of snakes causing bites, antivenom effectiveness to prevent death, untreated mortality, risk of Early Adverse Reactions (EAR), mortality risk from EAR, mean age at bite and remaining life expectancy, and disability risk (amputation). End-user costs applied included: costs of diagnosing and monitoring envenoming, antivenom drug cost, supportive care, shipping/freezing antivenom, transportation to-and-from hospital and feeding costs while on admission, management of antivenom EAR and free alternative snakebite care for ineffective antivenom. Principal Findings We calculated a cost/death averted of ($2330.16) and cost/DALY averted of $99.61 discounted and $56.88 undiscounted. Varying antivenom effectiveness through the 95% confidence interval from 55% to 86% yield a cost/DALY averted of $137.02 to $86.61 respectively. Similarly, varying the prevalence of envenoming caused by carpet viper from 0% to 96% yield a cost/DALY averted of $254.18 to $78.25 respectively. More effective antivenoms and carpet viper envenoming rather than non-carpet viper envenoming were associated with lower cost/DALY averted. Conclusions/Significance Treatment of snakebite envenoming in Nigeria is cost-effective with a cost/death averted of $2330.16 and cost/DALY averted of $99.61 discounted, lower than the country's gross domestic product per capita of $1555 (2013).

  {"id":"habib_public_2013","abstract":"Snakebite envenoming is a major public health problem among rural communities of the Nigerian savanna. The saw-scaled or carpet viper (Echis ocellatus) and, to a lesser extent, the African cobras (Naja spp.) and puff adders (Bitis arietans) have proved to be the most important cause of mortality and morbidity. The main clinical features of E. ocellatus envenoming are systemic hemorrhage, incoagulable blood, shock, local swelling, bleeding and, occasionally, necrosis. Bites may be complicated by amputation, blindness, disability, disfigurement, mutilation, tissue destruction and psychological consequences. Antivenom remains the hallmark and mainstay of envenoming management while studies in Nigeria confirm its protection of over 80% against mortality from carpet-viper bites. However, the availability, distribution and utilization of antivenom remain challenging although two new antivenoms (monospecific EchiTab G and trispecific EchiTab ICP-Plus) derived from Nigerian snake venoms have proven very effective and safe in clinical trials. A hub-and-spoke strategy is suggested for broadening antivenom access to endemic rural areas together with instituting quality assurance, standardization and manpower training. With the advent of antivenomics, national health authorities must be aided in selecting and purchasing antivenoms appropriate to their national needs while manufacturers should be helped in practical ways to improve the safety, efficacy and potential coverage against snake venoms and pricing of their products.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,6,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Habib","given":"Abdulrazaq G."}],"container-title":"Journal of Venomous Animals and Toxins including Tropical Diseases","container-title-short":"Journal of Venomous Animals and Toxins including Tropical Diseases","DOI":"10.1186/1678-9199-19-27","ISSN":"1678-9199","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2013,10,17]]},"page":"27","source":"BioMed Central","title":"Public health aspects of snakebite care in West Africa: perspectives from Nigeria","title-short":"Public health aspects of snakebite care in West Africa","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1678-9199-19-27","volume":"19"},

  {"id":"ijeomah_utilization_2017","abstract":"The study reviewed utilization and threats to snakes in Nigeria. Snake as a group is one of the most hated by man, the manager of all resources. This hatred is partly due to the fear man has for snake as a group that can kill both human beings and domestic animal leading to economic loses and reduction in human population. Contrarily the presence of man is also a threat to snake. In spite of the balance of terror that exists between man and snake, man uses almost every part of snake for various purposes. Commonly used parts of snakes include; liver, gallbladder, venom, fats and skin. The killing substance in snake, the venom especially that of cobra is very important in the treatment of cancer and other terminal diseases. Snake venom is an essential raw material in the chemical, pharmaceutical, cosmetic and medical industries. Snake meat is considered a delicacy in many communities although some areas forbid its consumption. Snake meat is a cheap source of the much needed animal protein in many rural areas. Snake reduces the population of many pests such as rodents that cause economic loses to man by feeding on agricultural products. The skin of snake is used for decoration, and can be processed into high quality and colourful leather for the production of shoes, bags, and belts. The fat of Python has anti-inflammatory properties. It is used for the treatment of scars and bones. The virtues of snake are underutilized in Nigeria.

  {"id":"iliyasu_effect_2015","abstract":"INTRODUCTION: Snakebite envenoming is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in rural areas of the tropics. Timely administration of effective antivenom remains the mainstay of management.\nMETHODS: The study was a quantitative descriptive study aimed at exploring the causes and effects of delay, distance and time taken to access care on snakebite outcomes in Nigeria. All prospective snakebite victims reporting to Kaltungo General Hospital were enrolled. Data on demography, date and time bitten, date and time admitted, site of bite, circumstances of snakebite, responsible snake, clinical features, 20-minute whole-blood clotting test, antivenom administered and outcome were recorded. Delay arising from use of traditional first aid (TFA), time elapsed from snakebite to presentation and the shortest distance from bite location to the hospital was calculated or obtained using a global positioning system.\nRESULTS: The association between delay before hospital presentation and poor outcome was not statistically significant, even though there was a 2% higher likelihood of poor outcome among those with a 1-hour delay compared to those without delay (odds ratio 1.02, 95% confidence interval 1.00-1.03). There was no difference in distance from bite location to hospital between those with a poor outcome (74) compared to those with a good outcome (325). Those with a poor outcome had more severe envenomation requiring more antivenoms and longer hospital stays. Given poor access to antivenom therapy at distant locations &#8805;100 km, victims were more likely to use TFA such as black 'snake' stone, with consequent prolonged delays. Antivenoms should be more readily available at distant places.\nCONCLUSIONS: Community education on avoiding potentially harmful TFA and prompt access to care is recommended. There is a need to provide snakebite care to multiple peripheral, relatively more rural inaccessible areas.","author":[{"family":"Iliyasu","given":"Garba"},{"family":"Tiamiyu","given":"Abdulwasiu B."},{"family":"Daiyab","given":"Farouq M."},{"family":"Tambuwal","given":"Sirajo H."},{"family":"Habib","given":"Zaiyad G."},{"family":"Habib","given":"Abdulrazaq G."}],"container-title":"Rural and Remote Health","container-title-short":"Rural Remote Health","ISSN":"1445-6354","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2015]]},"language":"eng","page":"3496","PMID":"26590373","source":"PubMed","title":"Effect of distance and delay in access to care on outcome of snakebite in rural north-eastern Nigeria","type":"article-journal","volume":"15"},

  {"id":"larsen_forest_2008","abstract":"An extended study of the 972 forest butterflies (Lepidoptera: Papilionoidea and Hesperioidea) in Africa west of the Dahomey Gap, covering the period 1990–2006, showed that 97% of all species ever recorded from the area were still present in one or more of the remaining forests within the region. This is despite the fact that during the past 150 or so years the forests have shrunk to 13% or less of their original extent, very little of which in pristine condition. The 34 species not recorded during the study period mainly belong to genera and species-groups that are rare, local, or difficult of access—species that any collector would be lucky to find once in a lifetime. A few may actually be “phantom species” or mislabelled butterflies from other parts of Africa. Effectively it seems that no butterfly has yet gone regionally extinct in West Africa. Two-thirds of the 34 species not recorded between 1990 and 2006 were found elsewhere in Africa. This should be a source of pride and encouragement for all concerned with nature conservation in the region. The long-term survival of fauna and flora is wholly dependent on the continued existence of sufficient broadleaf forest in reasonable condition. It is possible that accumulated “extinction debt” will still lead to loss of species, a process that should be closely monitored. The remaining area of forest of high quality is small, fragile and now contained almost exclusively within the formal protected areas systems: its continued conservation is vital. Many challenges still exist and much hard work remains to consolidate the conservation of West African biodiversity.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,6,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Larsen","given":"Torben B."}],"container-title":"Biodiversity and Conservation","container-title-short":"Biodivers Conserv","DOI":"10.1007/s10531-008-9399-z","ISSN":"1572-9710","issue":"12","issued":{"date-parts":[[2008,5,7]]},"language":"en","page":"2833","source":"Springer Link","title":"Forest butterflies in West Africa have resisted extinction… so far (Lepidoptera: Papilionoidea and Hesperioidea)","title-short":"Forest butterflies in West Africa have resisted extinction… so far (Lepidoptera","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10531-008-9399-z","volume":"17"},

The primary outcome assessed was death or disability at hospital discharge. Victims were predominantly male farmers, and in 54 cases (75%) the snake was identified as a carpet viper (Echis ocellatus), with the remainder unidentified. Most subjects (58, 81%) attempted at least one first aid measure after the bite, including tourniquet application (53, 74%), application (15, 21%) or ingestion (10, 14%) of traditional concoctions, bite site incision (8, 11%), black stone application (4, 5.6%), and suction (3, 4.2%). The majority (44, 61%) presented late (after 4 hours). Most (53, 74%) had full recovery at hospital discharge. Three deaths (4.2%) and thirteen (18%) disabilities (mainly tissue necrosis) occurred. The use of any first aid was associated with a longer hospital stay than no use (4.6 ± 2.0 days versus 3.6 ± 2.7 days, respectively, P = 0.02). The antivenom requirement was greater in subjects who had used a tourniquet (P = 0.03) and in those who presented late (P = 0.02). Topical application (Odds Ratio 15, 95% CI 1.4-708) or ingestion of traditional concoctions (OR 20, 95% CI 1.4-963) were associated with increased risk of death or disability.

  {"id":"njoku_audit_2008","abstract":"<b>BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:</b> Snakebite is an important but often overlooked medical problem worldwide. This work is an audit of snakebite injuries in Sokoto, North West Nigeria using hospital-based data.\nMETHODOLOGY: A retrospective analysis of the records of all adult patients with snakebite managed at Usmanu Danfodiyo University Teaching Hospital Sokoto, North West Nigeria from January 2000 to December 2004 was carried out. Information retrieved included demographic and clinical data.\n<b>RESULTS:</b> Seventy three patients made up of 55 males (75.3%) and 18 females (24.7%) were involved. Male to female ratio was 3:1. Snakebite constituted 1.7 per 1000 hospital admissions and 12.7 per 1000 medical admissions. 82.2% of the patients were between 15 and 40 years of age. 89% of the bites were between the months of March and October. 54.8% of the patients were bitten in the home environment while 39.7% were bitten in the bush. The lower limbs were the most common sites of bite (58.9%). Most( 63%) of the bites occurred during the daytime. 50.7% of the patients showed signs of envenomation while 64.4% received antivenom. Majority of the patients survived and 2.7% of the patients died. The outcome was unknown in 26.0% of patients.\n<b>CONCLUSION:</b> Snakebite constitutes an important cause of hospital admission and occurs mainly during the rainy season which coincides with the period of intense farming activities in the study population. The build up commences during the period of intense heat. Envenomation status of patients need to be accurately determined to avoid excessive use of antivenoms with the attendant risk to patients.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,6,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Njoku","given":"E.

  {"id":"ogunfowokan_relationship_2011","abstract":"BACKGROUND: Envenomation from snake bites is a public health hazard in tropical countries. The observed mortality among in-hospital patients bitten by carpet viper (Echis ocellatus) in northern Nigeria has drastically reduced, related to the use of a mono-specific ovine Fab anti-snake venom. However, many victims survive with temporary or permanent physical or psychological sequelae.\nOBJECTIVE: Our aim was to find the relationship between bite-to-hospital time and morbidity in patients bitten by carpet viper.\nMETHODS: A prospective study was conducted in North-Central Nigeria. The signs of morbidity scored were oedema, tenderness, prolonged whole blood clotting time, blister, ulcer, need for blood transfusion, coma, hypotension, convulsion, length of hospital stay, need for disarticulation, and need for skin graft. A score of 1 was given to each objective and verifiable sign. Bite-to-hospital time of 233 subjects was obtained.\nRESULTS: Most of the subjects, 150(64%) came to the hospital within six hours of snake bite, out of whom two(1%) came within one hour. The median bite-to-hospital time was five hours with a range of 0.5-216 hours. Major morbidities were oedema accounting for 212 (91.0%; 95% CI =86.6-94.3%). incoagulable blood was seen in 205(88%; 95% CI = 83.1-91.9%) and tenderness in 201(86.3%; 95% CI = 81.2-90.4%). The mean morbidity score was 8 ± 4. For every unit increase in log bite-to-hospital time, the morbidity score increased by 1.85 (p < 0.001).\nCONCLUSION: Morbidity caused by carpet viper bite is high in Nigeria and worsens with increasing bite-to-hospital time.","author":[{"family":"Ogunfowokan","given":"O."},{"family":"Jacob","given":"D.

This study was therefore done to determine the prevalence, morbidity, mortality, and the orthodox treatment of victims. \nMethods: The study was retrospective and data on victims of snake bite covering a period of twenty years were obtained from the records as contained in the individual patients\\' case files available at the University of Benin Teaching Hospital and Central Hospital, Benin City. \nResults: Males were twice more often bitten than females, and teenagers and youths in their early twenties constituted the peak age range of victims. Most victims (59.5%) were bitten in the bush or farm. The limbs were the commonest sites of bite with the feet (73.5%) and arms (20.9%) more frequently bitten; both the upper and lower right limbs were also more frequently bitten than the corresponding left limbs. All patients who showed symptoms of envenomation (68.3%) received polyvalent antivenom, 67.4% received antibiotics while over 90% of patients received antitetanus prophylaxis.

  {"id":"sani_presentation_2013","abstract":"Background: Snake bite with envenomation is a medical emergency. Children are at risk of severe manifestations due to small body mass. Unlike adult population, there is limited data on snake bite among children in Sokoto, North-Western Nigeria. We described the presentation and outcome of snake bite in children presenting to the Emergency Pediatric Unit of Usmanu Danfodiyo University Teaching Hospital, Sokoto. Materials and Methods: Case records of all children managed for snake bites from 1 st January 2003 to 31 st December 2012 were retrospectively reviewed. Demographic and other relevant information were retrieved and data analyzed using Microsoft Excel. Results: Out of 23,570 Pediatric admissions, 36 children had snake bites giving prevalence of 0.0015 (1.5/1000). Male: Female ratio was 1.6:1, with a mean (standard deviation) age of 9.6 ± 2.8 years (range = 1-14 years). Snakebites involved the lower limbs in 52.8%; and at home in 69.4%, and during the night in 58.3% of patients. The highest prevalence of bite was between April and July. Features of envenomation included local swelling (100%), prolonged clotting time (61.1%) and spontaneous hemorrhage (epistaxis and hematemesis) in 11.1%. One patient (2.8%) had seizure which may be incidental, though common causes such as hypoglycemia, malaria and meningitis were excluded by laboratory investigations. Polyvalent anti-snake venom was administered in 29 (80.6%) children, with adverse reaction observed in 13.8% (4/29) of the patients. Thirteen patients (36.1%) signed against medical advice while the remaining 23 (63.9%) were discharged home. Conclusion: Snake envenomation is associated with low morbidity and mortality in our study. Measures aimed at eliminating snake habitats around residential areas should be encouraged.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,6,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Sani","given":"UsmanM"},{"family":"Jiya","given":"NmaM"},{"family":"Ibitoye","given":"PaulK"},{"family":"Ahmad","given":"MohamadM"}],"container-title":"Sahel Medical Journal","container-title-short":"Sahel Medical Journal","DOI":"10.4103/1118-8561.125557","ISSN":"1118-8561","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2013]]},"language":"en","page":"148-153","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Presentation and outcome of snake bite among children in Sokoto, North-Western Nigeria","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.smjonline.org/text.asp?2013/16/4/148/125557","volume":"16"},

  {"id":"ullenbruch_reptiles_2010","abstract":"We report on a collection of reptiles made in southern Benin, mostly in the vicinity of Lama Forest, a relict rain forest surrounded by savannah habitats within the the so-called Dahomey gap. 48 species (3 chelonian, 20 saurian and 25 ophidian species were encountered) are listed with the respective voucher material and commented in respect to taxonomic or ecological information. Five lizard species (Agama sylvanus, Hemidactylus ansorgei, H. lamaensis n. sp., Holaspis guentheri, Varanus ornatus) and two snake species (Natriciteres variegata, Amblyodipsas unicolur) are new for the fauna of Benin, the second Hemidactylus species being even new to science. Some other species are reported from Benin for only the second time.","author":[{"family":"Ullenbruch","given":"Klaus"},{"family":"Grell","given":"Olaf"},{"family":"Böhme","given":"Wolfgang"},{"family":"Koenig","given":"Zoologisches Forschungsmuseum Alexander"}],"container-title":"Bonn zoological Bulletin","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2010]]},"language":"en","page":"31–54","source":"Zotero","title":"Reptiles from southern Benin, West Africa, with the description of a new Hemidactylus (Gekkonidae), and a country-wide checklist","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.lacerta.de/AF/Bibliografie/BIB_4539.pdf","volume":"57"},
  {"id":"warrell_necrosis_1976","abstract":"The Spitting Cobra, Naja nigricollis, is widely and densely distributed in Africa. Fourteen patients with proven N. nigricollis bites, who were seen in the savanna region of Nigeria, did not exhibit the neurological signs, such as cranial nerve lesions and respiratory paralysis, expected following Elapid poisoning. All had local swelling, in eight cases involving the entire limb, and ten developed local tissue necrosis. Spontaneous haemorrhage was detected in three cases and was the probable cause of death in one of them; the other death in this series was unexplained. Haematological abnormalities included prolonged clot lysis anf failure of clot retraction due to a platelet defect. There was no specific deficit in clotting factors and a delayed rise in fibrin degradation products was attributed to extensive tissue damage at the site of the bit. Most patients showed depletion of complement component C3 and glycine-rich beta-glycoprotein (GBG), suggesting activation of the alternative pathway of complement fixation. There was evidence of hepatocellular damage in two out of six patients investigated. There was no evidence that specific polyvalent antivenoms, used in doses of up to 80 ml, prevented any of the effects of N. nigricollis venom. Clinical laboratory diagnosis is discussed. In the past many bites were wrongly classified as viper bites on the basis of clinical findings. Immunodiagnosis is a promising method for assessing the true importance of N. nigricollis bite in West Africa.","author":[{"family":"Warrell","given":"D. A."},{"family":"Greenwood","given":"B.
