Design/methodology/approach The article is a commentary. Findings The article finds that the Dublin Core metadata standard is moribund and that a newer, competing standard has rendered it essentially useless. Originality/value The paper updates Dublin Core’s increasing obsolescence and will help librarians understand the standard’s rapid rise and slow fall.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,4,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Beall","given":"Jeffrey"}],"container-title":"Library Hi Tech News","DOI":"10.1108/LHTN-07-2014-0058","ISSN":"0741-9058","issue":"9","issued":{"date-parts":[[2014,1,1]]},"page":"11-13","publisher":"Emerald Group Publishing Limited","source":"Emerald Insight","title":"Dublin Core is still dead","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1108/LHTN-07-2014-0058","volume":"31"},

  {"id":"cheby_open_2016","abstract":"Open access (OA) is a form of publication that allows some level of free access to scholarly publications. The Directory of Open Access Journals (DOAJ) is a repository to which OA journals may apply and upload content to increase discoverability. OA also refers to metadata that is freely available for harvesting. In making metadata open access, standards for schemes and protocols are needed to facilitate interoperability. For open access journals, such as those listed in the DOAJ, providing open access metadata in a form that promotes interoperability is essential for discoverability of their content. This paper investigates what standards exist or are emerging, who within journals is creating the metadata for DOAJ journals, and how are those journals and DOAJ sharing the metadata for articles. Moreover, since creating metadata requires specialized knowledge of both librarians and programmers, it is imperative that journals wanting to publish with OA metadata formulate plans to coordinate these experts and to be sure their efforts are compatible with current standards and protocols.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,4,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Cheby","given":"Lisa E"}],"container-title":"School of Information Student Research Journal","container-title-short":"Student Research Journal","DOI":"10.31979/2575-2499.060104","ISSN":"2575-2499","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016,6,20]]},"language":"en","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Open Access Metadata for Journals in Directory of Open Access Journals: Who, How, and What Scheme?","title-short":"Open Access Metadata for Journals in Directory of Open Access Journals","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://scholarworks.sjsu.edu/ischoolsrj/vol6/iss1/4","volume":"6"},

  {"id":"keenan_why_2010","abstract":"The Mansfield Library subscribes to the Readex database U.S. Congressional Serial Set, 1817-1994 (full-text historic reports of Congress and federal agencies). Given the option of purchasing MARC records for all 262,000 publications in the Serial Set or making use of free access to simple Dublin Core records provided by Readex, the library opted to repurpose the free metadata. The process that the Mansfield Library used to obtain the Dublin Core records is described, including the procedures for crosswalking the metadata to MARC and batch loading the bibliographic records complete with holdings information to the local catalog. This report shows that we successfully achieved our goals of dramatically increasing access to Serial Set material by exposing metadata in the local catalog and discusses the challenges we faced along the way. We hope that others tasked with the manipulation of metadata will be able to use what we learned from this project.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,4,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Keenan","given":"Teressa M."}],"container-title":"The Code4Lib Journal","ISSN":"1940-5758","issue":"11","issued":{"date-parts":[[2010,9,21]]},"source":"Code4Lib Journal","title":"Why Purchase When You Can Repurpose?

Pressed to find new solutions for failing manual workflows for serials and government document resource management, the eCataloger Framework was extended to FRBR to automate and enhance serials management and government documents receiving.  Based on successfully FRBRizing the eCataloger, Western State College converted their e-Library management from Dublin Core to FRBR and MODS.
