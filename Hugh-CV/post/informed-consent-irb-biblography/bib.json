  {"id":"brunon-ernst_fallacy_2015-1","abstract":"Orthodox contract law theory assumes that parties agree to the terms of a contract before entering into an agreement. However, recent factual evidence points towards the fact that consumers do not systematically read, and thus become informed of, the terms of a contract. Academics are asking for mandatory frameworks to ensure that informed consent is indeed sought and given by parties to a contract. The present study looks into the user agreements of four online companies that provide a marketplace for the sale of goods or free provision of services by other sellers and/or users (Ebay, Tripadvisor, YouTube and Amazon). The aim is firstly to identify the lexical/textual markers and peri-textual features of agreement in order to highlight the fallacy of informed consent. Secondly, the paper lists textual and peri-textual alternative contractual design (here called counter-design) in online user agreement. In so doing, contractual design features are distinguished from nudges. Suggested counter-design features help make informed consent effective.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,1,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Brunon-Ernst","given":"Anne"}],"container-title":"Revista Alicantina de Estudios Ingleses","container-title-short":"RAEI","DOI":"10.14198/raei.2015.28.03","ISSN":"2171-861X, 0214-4808","issue":"28","issued":{"date-parts":[[2015,11,15]]},"language":"en","page":"37","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"The Fallacy of Informed Consent: Linguistic Markers of Assent and Contractual Design in Some E-User Agreements","title-short":"The Fallacy of Informed Consent","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://raei.ua.es/article/view/2015-n28-the-fallacy-of-informed-consent-linguistic-markers-of-assent-and-contractual-design-in-some-e-user-agreements"},

Without complete and understandable information, patients are unable to make an autonomous clinical decision but must sign an informed consent form following the doctor’s medical arrangement. Three barriers to accessing medical information by patients were identified: (1) medical information received by patients was insufficient to support their decision-making, (2) patients lacked medical knowledge to understand the perceptions of doctors and (3) patient–doctor interactions were insufficient in clinical settings.\n            \n            \n              Conclusions\n              Informed consent is implemented as an administrative procedure at the hospital level in China. However, it has not been embedded in doctors’ clinical practices because, from the perspective of patients, doctors do not fulfil the obligation of medical information provision. As a result, the informed part of informed consent was neglected by individual doctors in China. Reforming medical education, monitoring the process of informed consent in clinical settings and redesigning medical institutional arrangements are pathways to restoring the practice of informed consent and patient-centred models in China.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,2,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Gong","given":"Ni"},{"family":"Zhou","given":"Yinhua"},{"family":"Cheng","given":"Yu"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Xiaoqiong"},{"family":"Li","given":"Xuting"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Xia"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Guiting"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Jingyu"},{"family":"Meng","given":"Hongyan"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Meifen"}],"container-title":"BMJ Open","container-title-short":"BMJ Open","DOI":"10.1136/bmjopen-2017-020658","ISSN":"2044-6055, 2044-6055","issue":"10","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,10]]},"language":"en","page":"e020658","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Practice of informed consent in Guangdong, China: a qualitative study from the perspective of in-hospital patients","title-short":"Practice of informed consent in Guangdong, China","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://bmjopen.bmj.com/lookup/doi/10.1136/bmjopen-2017-020658","volume":"8"},

  {"id":"jol_ethical_2016","abstract":"In this paper we discuss the ethical aspects of secondary use of language data: data that have been created and stored for purposes such as administration, training or quality monitoring. Such recordings provide interesting natural language data that stay clear of the observer’s paradox (Labov, 1972). Additionally, they offer opportunities for the field of applied linguistics that seeks to understand everyday language use and to assist language users. However, obtaining informed consent from interactants can be extremely difficult if gatekeepers shield them from researchers for reasons of professional ethics or because of legislation. In this article, we draw on our conversation analytic research into police interviews with child witnesses to argue a) that conceptualizing pre-recorded data as archival data is more appropriate than applying the ‘human participants’ ethical model; and b) that if sufficient protective measures are taken, secondary use of data without informed consent can be ethically sound.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,2,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Jol","given":"Guusje"},{"family":"Stommel","given":"Wyke"}],"container-title":"Dutch Journal of Applied Linguistics","container-title-short":"DuJAL","DOI":"10.1075/dujal.5.2.06jol","ISSN":"2211-7245, 2211-7253","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016,12,31]]},"language":"en","page":"180-195","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Ethical considerations of secondary data use: What about informed consent?","title-short":"Ethical considerations of secondary data use","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.jbe-platform.com/content/journals/10.1075/dujal.5.2.06jol","volume":"5"},

I then consider how the 2018 revisions to the Common Rule extend “colonial unknowing” by decontextualizing the forms of risk involved in social and behavioral research.

The results illustrate how researchers undertook efforts to fulfill ethical responsibilities in Internet-based research. They show how researchers’ self-narrated concerns and contextual conditions have mediated ethics-related research practices as reported in these studies. The results indicate the need for researchers to enhance critical awareness and assessment of potential ethical issues when conducting Internet-based research. Such critical awareness is essential for researchers to initiate and sustain an ongoing dialogue concerning ethics-related research practices in Internet-based applied linguistics research.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,2,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Tao","given":"Jian"},{"family":"Shao","given":"Qing"},{"family":"Gao","given":"Xuesong"}],"container-title":"Applied Linguistics Review","DOI":"10.1515/applirev-2016-2024","ISSN":"1868-6303, 1868-6311","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017,1,27]]},"source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Ethics-related practices in Internet-based applied linguistics research","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.degruyter.com/view/j/alr.2017.8.issue-4/applirev-2016-2024/applirev-2016-2024.xml","volume":"8"},
