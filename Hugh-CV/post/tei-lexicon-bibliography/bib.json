  {"id":"banski_enhancing_2008","abstract":"This paper describes a project aimed at converting a legacy representation of English idioms into an XML-based format. The project is set in the context of a large electronic English-Polish dictionary which contains several hundred formalized idiom descriptions and which has been released under the terms of a free license. In short, the project consists of three phases: cleaning up the dictionary markup, extracting the legacy idiom representations, and converting them into TEI P5 XML constrained by a RelaxNG grammar created for this purpose and constituting a module that can be included as part of the TEI P5 schema. The paper contains general descriptions of the individual phases and several examples of XML-encoded idioms. It also suggests some directions for further research, which include abstracting the XML-ized idiom representations into general syntactic patterns and using the representations to automatically identify idioms in tagged corpora.","author":[{"family":"Bański","given":"Piotr"},{"family":"Moszczyński","given":"Radosław"}],"container-title":"LERC","issued":{"date-parts":[[2008]]},"language":"English","page":"2619-2622","title":"Enhancing an English-Polish electronic dictionary for multiword expression research","type":"chapter","URL":"https://hal.inria.fr/hal-01757108"},

A variety of lexicon schemas have been developed, with goals ranging from computational lexicography (DATR) through archiving (LIFT, TEI) to standardization (LMF, FSR). A number of requirements for lexicon schemas are given. The lexicon schemas are introduced and compared to each other in terms of conversion and usability for this particular user group, using a common lexicon entry and providing examples for each schema under consideration. The formats are assessed and the final recommendation is given for the potential users, namely to request standard compliance from the developers of the tools used.
