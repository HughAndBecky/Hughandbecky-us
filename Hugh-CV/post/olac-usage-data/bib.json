  {"id":"bird_towards_2021","abstract":"The Open Language Archives Community (OLAC) provides a comprehensive infrastructure that has allowed our community to index and discover language resources over the past 20 years. However, OLAC infrastructure has fallen behind as the digital libraries community has continued to evolve. New investment is required in order to move OLAC into the digital libraries mainstream. This paper reports on the first 20 years of OLAC and on an agenda leading to a more sustainable future for open language archiving.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,2,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Bird","given":"Steven"},{"family":"Simons","given":"Gary F"}],"citation-key":"bird_towards_2021","container-title":"Proceedings of the International Workshop on Digital Language Archives: LangArc 2021","DOI":"10.12794/langarc1851171","editor":[{"family":"Zavalina","given":"Oksana"},{"family":"Chelliah","given":"Shobhana Lakshmi"}],"event-place":"Denton, Texas","event-title":"International Workshop on Digital Language Archives","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,10,7]]},"language":"en","page":"25-28","publisher":"University of North Texas","publisher-place":"Denton, Texas","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Towards an Agenda for Open Language Archiving","type":"paper-conference","URL":"https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc1851171/"},
  {"id":"wenige_retrieval_2018-1","abstract":"This paper investigates how Linked Open Data (LOD) can be used for recommendations and information retrieval within digital libraries. While numerous studies on both research paper recommender systems and Linked Data-enabled recommender systems have been conducted, no previous attempt has been undertaken to explore opportunities of LOD in the context of search and discovery interfaces. We identify central advantages of Linked Open Data with regard to scientific search and propose two novel recommendation strategies, namely flexible similarity detection and constraint-based recommendations. These strategies take advantage of key characteristics of data that adheres to LOD principles. The viability of Linked Data recommendations was extensively evaluated within the scope of a web-based user experiment in the domain of economics. Findings indicate that the proposed methods are well suited to enhance established search functionalities and are thus offering novel ways of resource access. In addition to that, RDF triples from LOD repositories can complement local bibliographic records that are sparse or of poor quality.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,4,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Wenige","given":"Lisa"},{"family":"Ruhland","given":"Johannes"}],"citation-key":"wenige_retrieval_2018-1","container-title":"International Journal on Digital Libraries","DOI":"10.1007/s00799-017-0224-8","event-place":"Heidelberg, Netherlands","ISSN":"14325012","issue":"2-3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,9]]},"language":"English","license":"International Journal on Digital Libraries is a copyright of Springer, (2017).
