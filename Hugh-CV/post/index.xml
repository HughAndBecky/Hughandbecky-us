      <description>&lt;p&gt;Rights and access are a major issue in &amp;ldquo;ethical&amp;rdquo; linguistics. That is, within the European Union (but also elsewhere) there has been a major push to make research outputs Open Access. Often in this context the presupposition is that the research is being conducted as part of federal/national government organizations such as institutes or universities.  However, other organizational structures exist both within Europe and elsewhere. For instance, research may be conducted at a private corporation, by a non-profit organization, or by a private university, or by an unaffiliated individual. The push for Open Access has often been positioned within a narrative, that access to and reuse of government funded research outputs should not become encumbered by legal constraints. The ensuing argument then for linguistic research, which is often grant funded by governments is that the &amp;ldquo;ethical approach to research&amp;rdquo; is that the research outputs are costlessly accessible and unencumbered in their re-use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are several frameworks which establish rights within the EU context. However, the primary one which has been addressed in the literature and is presented as an encumberment to &amp;ldquo;research&amp;rdquo; is the &lt;em&gt;copyright framework&lt;/em&gt;. To address encumberments by the copyright framework and other ethical considerations, the 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201618&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;FAIR guidelines were developed&lt;/a&gt;. FAIR addresses the copyright consideraction through the suggestion of using creative commons licenses. This essentially releases copyright liability which is  automatically applied via the copyright framework. This is usually done through a Creative Commons license, applied by the work&amp;rsquo;s creator. However, two major issues with this strategy seem to not be addressed by the larger publishing (and equally applicable to all research outputs) and distribution networks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Addressing the 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work_for_hire&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Work-for-Hire doctrine&lt;/a&gt; where the research was conducted as part of the work a researcher was hired to do for an organization. That is, an author (researcher at a university) does not have the right to apply a creative commons license to their authored works, rather, it is their employer who holds this right. What is vastly under-expressed in the academic creative commons licensed literature is how the rights of the employing organizations are being curtailed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second issue with some creative commons licensed works is the use of the &amp;ldquo;non-commercial&amp;rdquo; clause. This clause has no discrete definition. As such it is not clear how it should or &lt;em&gt;should not&lt;/em&gt; be applied. But applied especially in the context of academic business activities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This set of references tracts some of the issues which are raised under the first point above. The application of the employer–employee contract in the context of academic institutions.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Microphone Recommendations</title>
      <link>https://hughandbecky.us/Hugh-CV/post/microphone-recommendations/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 21 May 2021 14:35:45 +0100</pubDate>
      <guid>https://hughandbecky.us/Hugh-CV/post/microphone-recommendations/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;From time to time I get asked what set up I recommend for linguists&amp;rsquo; to use when they are making field recordings. The requests often go like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greetings, I&amp;rsquo;m writing because I am just about to head out to do field work for my degree and I&amp;rsquo;m wondering if you have any advice on the latest audio recorders for linguistic fieldwork.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My response is invariably to pivot and respond to the question by asking what sort of products they would like to make. That is, linguists need to think about what can be done with the recordings, and how they need to influence the audio product&amp;rsquo;s creation and future use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Making good audio recordings is about making recordings someone will want to listen to again, and again, and again. Invariably researchers (linguists) will listen to their recordings over and over again as they transcribe them. However their recordings gain value when others also want to listen to them. I recently was listening to a presentation where the presenter from Brazil, demonstrated some audio recordings from his field work. He showed a picture of the recording set up. In the picture it showed that he was using a Zoom H4n. In the recordings it was evident that the gain on the mics was pumped really high. The picture showed that he was using the built in mics. In the recording, the background noise was really full front while the speaker was perceptually distant — the chicken and the noise floor (the sound of &amp;ldquo;air&amp;rdquo; in the recording) were louder than the language speaker. Controlling for these factors are fundamental issues in basic crafting of audio recordings. Craftsmen (and women) who appreciate their art will get the tools they need to make their art (and artifacts) usable and enjoyable. This presenter from Brazil, played a recording from a language in which there are only about 8 speakers left&amp;hellip; linguistically the language is already like a classic car with low mileage—RARE. However, a good recording of a rare language is like a classic car dipped in gold. Microphone choice and placement allows the audio craftsman to tune down the gain, get closer to the subject and thereby record at levels where the signal to noise ratio (the sound of &amp;ldquo;air&amp;rdquo;) and the chickens are not heard in the recording or are perceptively in the far background rather than in the foreground&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. The ability to attenuate a listener to specific parts of the audio stream is where the artistry and the skill comes into full view. It is this applied artistry that makes audio recordings valued and worth listing to over and over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In contrast to audio craftsmen, linguists are generally not interested in good sounding audio, they are only interested in completing their dissertation or the next published article which proves their theoretical hypothesis or generates points with their tenure and promotion board. Audio artifacts (recordings) are not primary products of interest to a linguist, rather it is what is done with them that is of their concern. This whole approach to language recording militants against good audio recordings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One linguist with whom I collaborated, when asked how they wanted to manage the recordings (both the technical aspect of production, and the file system organization of the recordings) was not concerned with either. That person was (at the time) ambivalent because their advisor was advising the PhD dissertation not some fieldwork project. That linguist&amp;rsquo;s goal wasn&amp;rsquo;t to produce a body of work (recordings) which could be used beyond the dissertation, the goal was to do enough fieldwork to complete the dissertation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the advisor&amp;rsquo;s perspective, as long as the fieldwork produced some written data to present in the dissertation the core requirements were satisfied. I followed the career of that linguist and now they are in a post-doc at a reputable organization. The post-doc was advertised pre-COVID and included funding for fieldwork. However, due to COVID this linguist has relied on their prior field recordings in (presumably) unexpected ways. The organization and quality of the recordings impacts their productivity as they now need to reference those recordings. Within the context of the current post-doc and the global climate, job performance productivity is not evaluated as being above average or below average. However, the career building blocks for the next post-doc or position is impacted, by how the fieldwork situation and production process was managed, and the quality of the product produced. I notice that career scholars produce about four publications a year in addition to the grants that they write and win. This is a very different interactive context than negotiating interpersonal relationships on a funded project (in a lab or in a village).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a audio craftsman, I use an an 
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.microphonemadness.com/products/mmdpsm.htm&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;MMaudio DPSM-SIL mic&lt;/a&gt; or one of two 
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.rode.com/microphones/m3&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Røde M3 mics&lt;/a&gt; with a Zoom H4n digital audio recorder.  The MMaudio mic is a special set up of the mmdpsm mic with longer cords (7 feet). To order it one must call the company because they don&amp;rsquo;t put the part on-line. I think there are a few other tweaks with the DPSM-SIL and the regularly advertised DPSM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do not use Phantom power with the DPSM-SIL there is a setting through the menu of the Zoom H4n that says &amp;ldquo;plug-in power&amp;rdquo;. Turn this on.  Also be careful of plugging in the mic into things like computers. I do not know what specific computer&amp;rsquo;s mic jack setting are but they might over power the mic and damage it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are technical reasons related to mic sensitivity and faithfulness to the input which lead me to choose these two mics in 2008. However, for me the ability to plan how audio should sound and the ability to create &amp;ldquo;three dimensional texture&amp;rdquo; within the audio recording is more important than a specific microphone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a craftsman I also suggest the use of headphones because live recordings need active monitoring. Hearing the recording is import to the production production process — what is on the recording is not what is heard in the recording environment. See my write up on headphones I have used here: &lt;a href=&#34;https://hugh.thejourneyler.org/2011/headphones-for-language-documentation&#34;&gt;https://hugh.thejourneyler.org/2011/headphones-for-language-documentation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section class=&#34;footnotes&#34; role=&#34;doc-endnotes&#34;&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:1&#34; role=&#34;doc-endnote&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found a different audio recording in a language archive which demonstrates the &amp;ldquo;air&amp;rdquo; and high-pitch noise induced into the recording. Presumably the high frequency pitch comes from the computer fan which is running nearby while recording. However, given the date of recording it might be the noise of the tape deck. The archive record does not make clear the original medium of recordings. From a sound engineer&amp;rsquo;s point of view, this is not great recording because the noise to signal ratio is really out of proportion. The recording is by Laurent Fontaine. Created in 2005. Titled: Histoire de Kanumá. &lt;a href=&#34;https://doi.org/10.24397/pangloss-0000495&#34;&gt;https://doi.org/10.24397/pangloss-0000495&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

      <title>Writing System Versions</title>
      <link>https://hughandbecky.us/Hugh-CV/post/writing-system-versions/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 14 May 2021 14:35:45 +0100</pubDate>
      <guid>https://hughandbecky.us/Hugh-CV/post/writing-system-versions/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;While working on a description of the Eastern Dan writing system I found it challenging to keep track of all the different writing system evolutions and the various materials produced in each writing system. As I listen to the challenges faced in various linguistic projects (archiving, OCR, language revitalization, corpus creation) around the world, which work with written linguistic materials I find that they also often have the same basic problems. That is, the same language may be written with different transcription systems. There is currently no clear and concise way to create an identifier for language transcription systems. Some have turned to the ISO 639-3 to say &amp;ldquo;the writing system of &lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt; language&amp;rdquo;, however this is often not descriptive enough. The 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://tools.ietf.org/rfc/bcp/bcp47&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;BCP47 identifier&lt;/a&gt; is much more descriptive and useful in this context.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I use the term writing system rather than orthography because orthography is narrowly construed in technological contexts. That is, &lt;em&gt;orthography&lt;/em&gt; applies to spelling, while &lt;em&gt;writing system&lt;/em&gt; applies to the characters used to communicate in a given language

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. Sometimes a writing system revision implies or necessitates an orthography change, sometimes it doesn&amp;rsquo;t. When an orthography change adds or removes a character (Unicode character) from the language it also implies a writing system change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These relationships are illustrated in the following graph replicated from

  &lt;img data-src=&#34;https://hughandbecky.us/Hugh-CV/Hugh-CV/post/writing-system-versions/constable2003_hu259b6ab67378f924615731584e28b6b1_79585_2000x2000_fit_lanczos_2.png&#34; class=&#34;lazyload&#34; alt=&#34;Orthography and writing system relationship diagram&#34; width=&#34;977&#34; height=&#34;768&#34;&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;



&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example the following languages and their writing system histories demonstrate some of the complexities which a catalogue of writing system evolutions would need to consider.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;tarok&#34;&gt;Tarok&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Tarok orthography falls in the category of an SIL revision in 1976 of a missionary orthography first produced in 1919. Tarok people did a comprehensive revision in 2018, covering alphabets and rules of the writing system. Tarok  [ISO 639-3: yer] is spoken Central Nigeria.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;dan&#34;&gt;Dan&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dan is a language of Liberia and the Ivory coast [ISO 639-3: dnj]. It requires three BCP47 codes to distinguish the language-writing system combinations, because there are three writing systems one in Liberia, one for Eastern Dan, one for Western Dan. Historically, Dan-Kla [ISO 639-3: lda] now recognized as a separate language, was also lumped in with Dan, the ISO 639-3 registrar addressed this in 2013.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;##3# Eastern Dan
Within the Dan example Eastern Dan has a history of 5 writing system versions, some with SIL involvement, some without. These are writing system revisions, not orthography revisions because the glyphs used in each case were different. It wasn’t just the spelling system that changed, it what the character repertoire needed to write the language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;mephaa&#34;&gt;Me&amp;rsquo;phaa&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is a set of 4 ISO 639-3 languages but the Mexican government acknowledges something like 7 unique languages. They all share one writing system but spell words how they pronounce them in their respective regions. This means that there is one writing system, but several orthographies. As far as I know no orthography is standardized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;german&#34;&gt;German&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Four countries, various different writing systems (glyphs), countries have discrete version histories, but conceded that they have one language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;tem&#34;&gt;Tem&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A language which uses both Ajami and Latin scripts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With these kinds of issues in mind, I crafted the following fictitious statement which exemplifies some of the things for which a good catalogue of writing system versions would account.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Converting FLExText Files to XLingPaper Interlinear Texts</title>
      <link>https://hughandbecky.us/Hugh-CV/post/flextext-to-xlingpaper/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 07 May 2021 14:35:45 +0100</pubDate>
      <guid>https://hughandbecky.us/Hugh-CV/post/flextext-to-xlingpaper/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s assume that we have a generous friend who has gifted us an interlinearized text from FLEx with morpheme level glossing in the format of &lt;code&gt;.flextext&lt;/code&gt;. (&lt;code&gt;.flextext&lt;/code&gt; is an XML formated file.) And lets say we want to type set that file in XLingPaper. How can we do that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One might be tempted to import the &lt;code&gt;.flextext&lt;/code&gt; file into FLEx so that it can be re-exported with the XLingPaper exports from the FLEx menus, but this is not really a viable option becasue if we import that FLExText to an empty FLEx database, FLEx will not import the morpheme level annotations — it will recognize the free-translation and the baseline text. Bascially anything which is related to the lexicon part of the database is not viewable in the imported database.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However all is not lost we can use the XSLT transforms from FLEx by copying them to a usable location as the data start of those transforms is also &lt;code&gt;.flextext&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I run linux. On the command line I used &lt;code&gt;locate&lt;/code&gt; to find the XSL file titled &lt;code&gt;xml2XLingPapConcatMorphemes.xsl&lt;/code&gt; with &lt;code&gt;$ locate xml2XLingPapConcat&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It appeared on my comptuer at &lt;code&gt;/usr/share/fieldworks/Language Explorer/Export Templates/Interlinear/xml2XLingPapConcatMorphemes.xsl&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To run these transforms I was advised to use Saxon. Saxon is already installed on linux if XLingPaper is installed. Saxon comes with XMLMind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also used &lt;code&gt;locate&lt;/code&gt; to find the Saxon file with &lt;code&gt;$ locate saxon&lt;/code&gt;
Mine was located at: &lt;code&gt;/opt/xxe-perso-7_6_0/bin/saxon.jar&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The basic syntax for operating Saxon is as follows:
&lt;code&gt;java -cp &amp;quot;wherever_saxon.jar_is/saxon.jar&amp;quot; com.icl.saxon.StyleSheet the_flextext_file path_to_the XSLT_files/\xml2XLingPapConcatMorphemes.xsl  &amp;gt; the_XLingPaper_output_file.xml&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I then needed to change where I told Saxon the files were located. In my case I coppied the &lt;code&gt;.xsl&lt;/code&gt; files to their own folder within my project folder for simpler operation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are other &lt;code&gt;.xsl&lt;/code&gt; files for transforming FLExTexts to interlinear files in XLingPaper. These can be seen by using &lt;code&gt;locate&lt;/code&gt; or in the official repo:
Check for the other files in the official FLEx repo at: &lt;a href=&#34;https://gerrit.lsdev.sil.org/admin/repos/FieldWorks,&#34;&gt;https://gerrit.lsdev.sil.org/admin/repos/FieldWorks,&lt;/a&gt; or specifically look at XLingPaper export xsl transforms as discussed in their origional merge into the FLEx project: &lt;a href=&#34;https://gerrit.lsdev.sil.org/c/FieldWorks/+/1961&#34;&gt;https://gerrit.lsdev.sil.org/c/FieldWorks/+/1961&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Describing Serials in Dublin Core</title>
      <link>https://hughandbecky.us/Hugh-CV/post/describing-serials-in-dublin-core/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 05 Apr 2021 14:35:45 +0100</pubDate>
      <guid>https://hughandbecky.us/Hugh-CV/post/describing-serials-in-dublin-core/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Open Language Archives Community (OLAC) metadata profile is built on Dublin Core and OAI. Essentially OLAC feeds (to the OLAC aggregator) are modified OAI-PMH feeds. The profile was originally assumed to be describing archived language resources. However, there is a portion of the OLAC schema which allows the describer of a resource to indicate that the resource is a description of the resource rather than a language resource. This is useful for describing things like grammars and journal articles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My question is: &lt;em&gt;How might journal articles be best described?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are at least &amp;ldquo;archives&amp;rdquo; pushing journal articles to OLAC: the University of Hawaiʻi. pushes all of the journal &lt;em&gt;Language Documentation &amp;amp; Conservation&lt;/em&gt; to OLAC (but does not use ISO 639-3 codes in the records); the SIL Language &amp;amp; Culture Archive has records for many journal articles published by SIL and others. The GIAL/DIU library also has pushed records for journal articles or serials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Records from these three entites can serve as a baseline for current practice. However, how should journal articles, or even whole journals be described in Dublin Core? To this end I have started looking at the literature discussing how journal articles are described in the library science journals. The following bibliography is a compliation of the works consulted so far.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gandalf&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Gandolf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;!--Why does the aged one who is a sage go to an archive? what does this say about using the sage as a corporate identity profiles? or about archive managment--&gt;, but I would like to situate my arguments within the context of other literature about Gandolf. A trip to the library was in order to discover what sort of resources are out there to be consulted. A few years ago I ran across the Journal of Inklings Studies which was focused on all authors who were part of the writers circle, Inklings, which included J.R.R. Tolkien and C.S. Lewis. The series of journals to consult appear below. In addition there are newsletters from various societies which are not listed.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Presenting Oral Texts with Transcriptions Online</title>
      <link>https://hughandbecky.us/Hugh-CV/post/presenting-oral-texts-with-transcriptions-online/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 21 Mar 2021 01:41:38 -0700</pubDate>
      <guid>https://hughandbecky.us/Hugh-CV/post/presenting-oral-texts-with-transcriptions-online/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;For several years I have been tracking the progression of how interlinear glossed texts (IGT) are interacted with online. This has several dimensions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the reason for the interaction and the goals of the interaction&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the visual layout and concepts driving the interaction&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the supporting technology choices used to make these interactions happen&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;also the content of glosses used in the texts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With regard to the first point above, I find that corpus tools generally fall into one of three broad catagories and this holds true even for browser based tools: Crafting, Display &amp;amp; Navigation, and Information Extraction &amp;amp; Pattern Discovery. Even though EXMARaLDA is not a browser based corpus too these catagories are exemplified in its 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://exmaralda.org/en/about-exmaralda/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;documentation&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EXMARaLDA is a system for working with oral corpora on a computer. It consists of a transcription and annotation tool (Partitur-Editor), a tool for managing corpora (Corpus-Manager) and a query and analysis tool (EXAKT)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have used this three way distinction to catagorize some of the different software options available for browser based interactions with IGT data&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;


&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;!-- For example many publishers use or require Leipzig glossing rules which point to a &#34;standard&#34; set of abbreviations, to be used in print publications. However, these abbreviations do not have a concrete set of definitions. Therefore one can never be exactly sure what an author means when they use these abbreviations (but in general shared conventions are more helpful than not). What I have noticed with respect to these abbreviations is that due to the mental/visual prominence the abbreviations have in print media, they are often being used in corpus annotations. To complicate matters, when additional annotations are needed but are not present in the Leipzig Glossing Rules chaos ensues. That is, authors choose to create their own abbreviations on an ad-hoc basis. Additionally abbreviations used in the Leipzig Glossing Rules by field linguists are often different from those used by computational linguists working on TreeBanks or WordNets creating a gap in the cross-discipline uses of corpora. --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While what is presented in terms of the content is still very important, &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; it is presented in an interactive mode is also important. That is, how is the experience crafted around the audio or video and the transcribed segments in terms of the &lt;em&gt;interaction design&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;visual design&lt;/em&gt;? I started to compile a list of these interactions which I present below. However, two significant components are influential in the life cycle of software and hence these interactions. First, the viral nature of the interaction, i.e., how easy is it to propagate the interaction in new contexts. Second, what is the life cycle of the technology undergirding the browser based experience? That is, how does the technology choice expose the user to obsolecence and technolgical debt. These two factors should be top ranking considerations when a project desires to &amp;ldquo;publish&amp;rdquo; or present interlinear texts online. In addition to these two factors, the following three design considerations will also impact the sustainability and maintainability of the online presence for the corpora and ought to be considered while planning for implementation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The first consideration is, &lt;em&gt;is there a required separation between data (content) and presentation?&lt;/em&gt; By separating on these lines the code produced to present the interlinear text can be re-used liberally across texts and projects, and the visual presentation can be adjusted and applied to texts at scale.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The second consideration is, &lt;em&gt;what is the quantity of dependencies that a visual presentation requires?&lt;/em&gt; That is, are there server based requirements for the generation of the visual presentation, or can the presentation happen without the server? Server based presentations require a long term maintenance plan. More dependencies require that the software be updated as each dependency evolves (potentially motivated by security issues). Dependencies may drop features that current interactions deemed important.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The third consideration is &lt;em&gt;what is the purpose of the web-presentation?&lt;/em&gt; There are different classes of tools with respect to interlinear glossed texts. Arguably, the one of primary importance is the archived version. That is, where is the text archived and can the archived version&amp;rsquo;s annotation be viewed while the audio is heard at the same time. A secondary consideration then is the working copy, or what can one &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; with the interlinear glossed text and how easy is it for people other than the author of the interlinear glossed text to do comparative searching across the text or in conjunction with other texts. Then a third consideration, is how is the canonical reference of the archived version persisted through to the working copy. That is, if the interlinear glossed text it loaded into an online system for investigation, does that system create new identifiers for the searches conducted or does it respect existing identifiers?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With these issues in mind I have been collecting images of the visual presentation of interlinear glossed texts online. In addition to my purpose for looking at ongoing evolution of the technical presentation of interlinear glossed text, I have been looking for a system that meets the requirements of points number one and two for use on a portfolio website like mine. Stated another way, I am looking for a tool which takes ELAN or FLExTexts and matches them with audio or video in the browser, rather than on a server. I want the tool to be limited to HTML5, JavaScript, and CSS3+.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is just a short list of tools for presenting time-aligned texts online. These would be in the middle category of the illustration above as they are designed for presentation and discovery of the resource rather than information extraction&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Notes&lt;/strong&gt;: This JavaScript library lines up interliear glosses based on spaces in the text file. Each row must be its own HTML paragraph. It can then number them for use as examples. It does not connect the the text to audio or video files, but it is great for use on blogs and websites. 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://libraries.io/bower/glosser&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Glosser&lt;/a&gt; is a similar kind of product, written in jQuery (JavaScript), but in my quick 3.5 minute review it looks like &lt;strong&gt;Leipzig.js&lt;/strong&gt; has more features than Glosser.

&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebVTT&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;.vtt&lt;/a&gt; files, which are type of sub-title file. In an alternative to using to the use of &lt;code&gt;.vtt&lt;/code&gt; files is to use an 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://wavesurfer-js.org/example/elan/index.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;existing wavesurfer.js plugin built for use with ELAN files&lt;/a&gt;. One major difference between these presentations is the orientation of the table which presents the interlinear glossed texts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;wavesurferjs--elan&#34;&gt;wavesurfer.js + ELAN&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Produced by&lt;/strong&gt;: J. Reuben Wetherbee&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Links&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a href=&#34;https://wavesurfer-js.org/example/elan/index.html&#34;&gt;https://wavesurfer-js.org/example/elan/index.html&lt;/a&gt; ; &lt;a href=&#34;https://wavesurfer-js.org/example/elan-wave-segment/index.html&#34;&gt;https://wavesurfer-js.org/example/elan-wave-segment/index.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Notes&lt;/strong&gt;: The ELAN plugin to wavesurfer.js was authored by 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/katspaugh/wavesurfer.js/pull/1052&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;J. Reuben Wetherbee&lt;/a&gt;. It appears in the wavesurfer.js documentation examples, but not in the 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://wavesurfer-js.org/plugins/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;main site&amp;rsquo;s list of plugins&lt;/a&gt;. Video.js is another project which can 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://collab-project.github.io/videojs-wavesurfer/#/examples&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;display video and text tracts&lt;/a&gt;. There is also 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://collab-project.github.io/videojs-wavesurfer/#/plugins&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;a plugin which connects video.js to wavesurfer.js&lt;/a&gt; [
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/collab-project/videojs-wavesurfer&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Github repo&lt;/a&gt; ]. So it seems that there might be a possibility to use one of either of these methods to present text annotations from ELAN and video together. However, I have not found any examples of this yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Note&lt;/strong&gt;: This was one of the earliest online presentations which linked grammars with texts. However, the system does not support collaborative editing or the creation of texts. It was originally designed to work with Toolbox formatted data, with other IGT formats support added later. It is open source and available via Github. It provides direct links to specific segments of the artifacts for the purpose of citation and referencing.&lt;/p&gt;

It is based on MediaWiki. It is designed for collaborative creation of annotated texts. It does not align the texts for display with video or audio. The same purpose of this service could be accomplished if ELAN annotations were under version control (like git) and collaborators interacted with version control and used ELAN on their local computers.&lt;/p&gt;

The text being played in the audio is not highlighted, but one can quickly access the transcribed text and copy it out as formatted LaTeX for inclusion as interlinear text in an other document (a pretty nifty feature).

It is great for referencing a particular point in an audio or transcribed textual artifact, within an the archive&amp;rsquo;s canonical location for the item.

&lt;strong&gt;Notes&lt;/strong&gt;:  Eastling Player is part of the 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/CNRS-LACITO&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Eastling suite: Easy Annotation and Synchronization Tool for linguists&lt;/a&gt;. It is developed in PHP and requires a server. It was developed in response to perceptions of server lag times in early versions of Pangloss (in the 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://pangloss.cnrs.fr&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;presentation interface managed by Villejuif&lt;/a&gt;; there are two interfaces). These versions of Pangloss converted ELAN files (XML) to HTML on request. As these XML files got longer they affected server-client transmission times. Technicians opted to parse these XML files into a databases to decrease load times. This is an interesting use of tools because the XML transforms could have been maintained and the HTML outputs cached or retained until XML files were updated. The alternative strategy would have not introduced PHP into the set of software required for the presentation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>PDFs from Webpages</title>
      <link>https://hughandbecky.us/Hugh-CV/post/pdfs-of-webpages/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 15 Jan 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://hughandbecky.us/Hugh-CV/post/pdfs-of-webpages/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the course of writing a paper I needed to take screen shots of webpages and include those as figures in the paper. I could take a screenshot save it as a .png or .jpg and call it good. However these sorts of images do not provide a great deal of resolution and do not look clean in a published paper. Especially when dealing with screenshots as the resolution is not very high — at least in my experince. I could print the web page to PDF but a post-script style PDF would basically create an image and wrap it in a PDF. This is not really any better than the screenshot solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a quick internet search I uncovered two potential solutions: 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://wkhtmltopdf.org&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;wkhtmltopdf&lt;/a&gt; and 
&lt;a href=&#34;http://cssbox.sourceforge.net/webvector/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;WebVector/CSSBox&lt;/a&gt;. I decided to try out &lt;code&gt;wkhtmltopdf&lt;/code&gt;. It was simple and easy to install on linux. It produces great resutls with a bit of tinkering (
&lt;a href=&#34;https://wkhtmltopdf.org/usage/wkhtmltopdf.txt&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;manual here&lt;/a&gt;). Though it should be noted that &lt;code&gt;wkhtmltopdf&lt;/code&gt; is based on webkit which has mostly not seen progressive development. I also tried WebVector (specifically on the website Pangloss) and it did not produce expected results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Playing around with wkhtmltopdf I was able to produce a PDF of several webpages I was looking to include. I used the following workflow after install:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I adjusted my screen size to fit the type of display I wanted. Then I measured it via 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://whatismyviewport.com&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;whatismyviewport.com&lt;/a&gt;. I took that and made it my viewport size. Then I played around with my output settings for the PDF. I knew that I wanted really low margins because I was going to embed this PDF as a figure in another PDF. Then I continued to play around with the page size to find the cut-off point between the content I wanted and the footer.
In the end the code I used looked like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;wkhtmltopdf --no-print-media-type --viewport-size 1100 --page-height 6.25in --page-width 7.75in -T 1mm -B 1mm -R 1mm -L 1mm --load-media-error-handling skip --enable-javascript --javascript-delay 2000 https://www.sil.org/resources/archives/52216 sil-item.pdf&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;wkhtmltopdf --no-print-media-type --viewport-size 1100 --page-height 8in --page-width 7.75in -T 1mm -B 1mm -R 1mm -L 1mm --load-media-error-handling skip --enable-javascript --javascript-delay 2000 https://scholarspace.manoa.hawaii.edu/handle/10125/30788 K-item.pdf&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;wkhtmltopdf --no-print-media-type --viewport-size 1100 --page-height 8.75in --page-width 7in -T 1mm -B 1mm -R 1mm -L 1mm --load-media-error-handling skip --enable-javascript --javascript-delay 2000 http://www.language-archives.org/item/oai:sil.org:52216 olac-item1.pdf&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This produced a nice PDF. But I needed to get rid of the second page. I did this with PDF-Shuffler and just deleted the second page.
I wanted to include the final PDF in XLingPaper which uses XeLaTeX on the back end. However one of the current dependencies only allows PDFs of version 1.4 or older. So I had to &amp;ldquo;back version&amp;rdquo; the PDF version to 1.4. I the following code (adjustin for file names) to do that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;gs -q -sDEVICE=pdfwrite -dCompatibilityLevel=1.4 -o out.pdf in.pdf&lt;/code&gt; &lt;!-- https://superuser.com/questions/25598/linux-pdf-version-converter --&gt;
My suspicion though is that passing the PDF through GhostSript also removes some of the mark-up features which already exist in the PDF via &lt;code&gt;wkhtmltopdf&lt;/code&gt;. This may include some of the links and embedded fonts — but on this last point I am not 100 percent sure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an earlier version of this workflow I was using standard size pages (A4, A3, etc.). Doing so required that I then cut the PDF so that the usable portion was able to usefully be scaled in xlingpaper. To do this I used 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://pdfresizer.com&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;pdfresizer.com&lt;/a&gt; to reduce the physical dimensions of pdf paes. However this was not necessary to maintain because I was able to specify the dimentions I needed directly in &lt;code&gt;wkhtmltopdf&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Digital Materiality for Language Artifacts</title>
      <link>https://hughandbecky.us/Hugh-CV/post/digital-materiality-for-language-artifacts/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 20 Aug 2020 01:41:38 -0700</pubDate>
      <guid>https://hughandbecky.us/Hugh-CV/post/digital-materiality-for-language-artifacts/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Several years ago while writing a portion of a paper which related to the use of certain keyboard layouts I started down the literature trail of &amp;ldquo;materiality studies&amp;rdquo;. The broad idea is that humans are impacted by the things in their environment and form special &amp;ldquo;attachments&amp;rdquo; or relationships with those things. So my question was &lt;em&gt;what sort of relationship do minority language users create with their language and how does the tool of a keyboard layout affect that relationship?&lt;/em&gt; We know that the kind of shovel available to someone digging a trench impacts how they approach the crafting of the trench, so in the same way what is the impact of one keyboard layout as opposed to a different one? The same question can be pose about two other &amp;ldquo;objects&amp;rdquo;. For example, consider a language&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;orthography&lt;/em&gt; many would not consider this an &amp;ldquo;object&amp;rdquo; in the traditional sense, but yet people engage with it as if it were an object. I think this is significant not just for materiality studies but also social anthropology and the social use of language artifacts. The second object or set of objects was the content of a &amp;ldquo;language archive&amp;rdquo;. That is, the materiality of language artifacts. We see that these artifacts are important and do have social relationships as evidenced by the nature of relationships that indigenous communities in the USA have with various archives and speech related artifacts. It is not only these communities, it is broader than that. For example 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://mukurtu.org&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Mukurtu&lt;/a&gt; a CMS solution for digital engagement with cultural heritage artifacts has some wide spread uptake among indigenous communities outside of the USA. One implication of materiality considerations is that the relationships and specific attitudes about relationships are communicable without actually having material artifacts move across communities. This then has significant relevance for language development and language revitalization studies.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Estimated Growth Rate of Linguistic Literature</title>
      <link>https://hughandbecky.us/Hugh-CV/post/linguistic-literature-growth-rate/</link>

      <guid>https://hughandbecky.us/Hugh-CV/post/linguistic-literature-growth-rate/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In an effort to establish the sufficiency of the indexing of academic papers in language description and linguistics I have started looking around to see what sort of estimates there are in terms of how many journals there are, how many linguists there are, and what the growth rate of the literature might be. As far as I know, no one has attempted a rate-of-growth calculation for linguistic literature across the discipline. There are some bibliometrics and scientometric studies focused on linguistics which look a specific journals, certain time depths across several journals

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.  These journals may be currently active or may have ceased their publishing, or changed the name of the journal (increasing the number of serials counted).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Defining the discipline is hard. For example, should one include the fields of Language Documentation, Anthropology, or Philology? Therefore the exact scope seems fuzzy but if we go with the 1700 number presented by the MIAR project it gives us a start. I have read several studies which focus on 10-year segment of a journal&amp;rsquo;s history (not linguistics) and they generally report that in a 10-year time span about 450 articles are produced.
One approach would be to multiply 450 by 1700 and estimate the number of articles from there (765,000 articles). But this leaves us without knowing how many active journals there are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have noticed that career linguists in the academy publish about three articles a year (more-or-less). Christopher Phipps, on his blog

    &lt;i&gt;How Many Linguists Are There? 5379.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; postulates that in 2010 there were about 5379 linguists. More-or-less this might give us a growth rate of about 16,000 articles per year. I recall reading somewhere that a major commercial linguistic bibliography added between 9,000 and 11,000 articles between its annual versions. Since we don&amp;rsquo;t anticipate complete coverage of by the team behind the bibliography it seems that the 16,000 number is closer to reasonable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we assume that the 16,000 number has been constant and covers the 765,000 total articles this gives us between 47 and 48 years of publishing history. Obviously the 765,000 number would be smaller than the total number of relevant language research publications (say since the 1500&amp;rsquo;s). But presumably the rate of publication growth is accelerating with innovations in publishing technology, the growth of the global population, and the growth of the academic and industrial application of language knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still another way of estimating how many articles are produced a year are to look at the rate of DOI usage or the growth of specific databases of articles. Not all journals or publishers use DOIs, and databases are also limited to those journals they index so it is not a fool-proof method but it would give us an approximate rate and a comparable rate with other disciplines. This method was attempted by

      <title>Bibliography of select papers on &#39;ethics&#39; and &#39;informed consent&#39; in Linguistic research</title>
      <link>https://hughandbecky.us/Hugh-CV/post/informed-consent-irb-biblography/</link>

      <guid>https://hughandbecky.us/Hugh-CV/post/informed-consent-irb-biblography/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is a short non-exhaustive bibliography of papers which discuss &lt;em&gt;Informed consent&lt;/em&gt; in the context of one or more of the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;minority language communities,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;low literacy levels,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;language research,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the legal aspect of the US IRB, and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;lsquo;how informed is informed consent&amp;rsquo; .&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have several nagging questions, which I wonder how discussed they are including: &amp;ldquo;Is Intellectual property rights of minority language people covered in the typical informed consent protocols of language researchers?&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;How ethical is it to create voice-to-speech tools for a small language community when only one or two people provide voice samples?&amp;rdquo; When working independently, outside the confines of an organization these factors are not mitigated by institutional barriers to creativity or participant considerations.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>XLingPaper Upgrade on Linux</title>
      <link>https://hughandbecky.us/Hugh-CV/post/xlingpaper-upgrade-on-linux/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 30 Oct 2018 14:35:45 +0100</pubDate>
      <guid>https://hughandbecky.us/Hugh-CV/post/xlingpaper-upgrade-on-linux/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I never remember how to upgrade XMLMind on Linux. Here are my notes on how to do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I follow the install directions here: &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.xmlmind.com/xmleditor/_distrib/doc/help/installing_xxe.html&#34;&gt;http://www.xmlmind.com/xmleditor/_distrib/doc/help/installing_xxe.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generally, the instructions follow like those below for version 8:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make sure that the Java™ bin/ directory is referenced in the $PATH and, at the same time, check that the Java™ runtime in the $PATH has the right version:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A command like the following will show the java version number.
&lt;code&gt;UserName$ java -version&lt;/code&gt; java version &amp;ldquo;10.0.1&amp;rdquo; 2018-04-17 Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment 18.3 (build 10.0.1+10) Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM 18.3 (build 10.0.1+10, mixed mode)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unpack the XXE distribution inside any directory you want:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;gt;
$ cd
$ unzip xxe-pro-8_2_0.zip
$ ls xxe-pro-8_2_0
addon/
bin/
demo/
doc/
...
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;XXE is intended to be used directly from the xxe-pro-8_2_0/ directory. That is, you can start XXE by simply executing:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ xxe-pro-8_2_0/bin/xxe &amp;amp;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can never remember what to do next. Here is the solution:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On my system &lt;code&gt;xxe &amp;amp;&lt;/code&gt; is sym-linked to the version that I want to be primary. This is done in &lt;code&gt;/usr/local/bin&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So then there is a script in &lt;code&gt;/usr/local/bin&lt;/code&gt; which points back to the application (I don&amp;rsquo;t really know as I didn&amp;rsquo;t write it), but the point is that the symlink needs to be adjusted and can be adjusted with a combination of these tips:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Find out which version of &lt;code&gt;xxe&lt;/code&gt; the item in &lt;code&gt;local/bin&lt;/code&gt; is pointed at with the following command:
&lt;code&gt;ls -l xxe&lt;/code&gt; Then if you want to adjust the versions one needs to over write the existing symlink. Or create a new one. In my case I changed &lt;code&gt;xxe&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;xxe7&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Do not adjust &lt;code&gt;~/.bash_profile&lt;/code&gt; as that will only mess things up&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did this once with &lt;code&gt;export $PATH=/absolute/path/to/xxe/&lt;/code&gt;and then my machine couldn&amp;rsquo;t find &lt;code&gt;/usr/local/bin&lt;/code&gt; any more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If one wants an &lt;code&gt;xxe&lt;/code&gt; command then use that, but for me so that I don&amp;rsquo;t have to update the command all the time I use &lt;code&gt;xxe7&lt;/code&gt; for XMLMind version 7 and &lt;code&gt;xxe8&lt;/code&gt; and so forth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;then symlink like so:
&lt;code&gt;cd /usr/local/bin&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;/usr/local/bin$&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;code&gt; sudo ln -s /home/username/path/to/XMLMind/xxe-version-folder/bin/xxe /usr/local/bin/xxe8&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>EndNote X8: A Review</title>
      <link>https://hughandbecky.us/Hugh-CV/post/endnote-x8-a-review/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 17 Apr 2018 14:35:45 +0100</pubDate>
      <guid>https://hughandbecky.us/Hugh-CV/post/endnote-x8-a-review/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Some days I just don&amp;rsquo;t like EndNote any more. In the past I have used a combination of 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://endnote.com&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;EndNote&lt;/a&gt; and 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.papersapp.com&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Papers2&lt;/a&gt;. A few years ago 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://hughandbecky.us/Hugh-CV/Hugh-CV/post/using-endnote-x4-for-mac/&#34;&gt;I wrote a review of EndNote X4 for Mac&lt;/a&gt; and I thought that I would go back and take a look at what I thought about that review and the new version of EndNote 8.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keep in mind that I have over 8,500 references in my EndNote file. My biggest complaints are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is slow.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There still is no keyboard short cut for importing a reference.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &amp;ldquo;detect duplicates&amp;rdquo; script does not allow one to exit successfully prior to completing all the items in your detected duplicate list. (Which for some might be very long, and cause the script to crash!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is no mechanism in the collections area to browse by journal or book-series.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When looking at a reference, there is no clear way to determine if it is in one of several collections (including in the check for duplicate script).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There does not seem to be an export style for exporting to bibJSON. (I might be creating one soon).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No auto suggest for missing citation metadata.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For me, EndNote, when importing citations which contain a relative link to a PDF on my machine, does not actually import the PDF to an endnote managed folder. I want all my PDFs in one place. And if they are not in the EndNote managed folder I want a visual indication that they are outside the EndNote data folder.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are my observations as I try and work with EndNote (and have over the last few months). For me, Papers2 (I haven&amp;rsquo;t bought Papers3) nailed the interaction around PDF management and citation management, from a User Experience perspective. Papers2 just didn&amp;rsquo;t have the custom fields necessary for me, So I was never able to completly rid myself of EndNote.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Keyboard layouts across languages: A Text input analysis framework proposal</title>
      <link>https://hughandbecky.us/Hugh-CV/post/a-text-input-analysis-framework/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 31 Mar 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://hughandbecky.us/Hugh-CV/post/a-text-input-analysis-framework/</guid>
      <description>&lt;!-- ## Proposal --&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Digital language death is a real issue for many small and under-resourced languages. To use Kornai’s (2013) terms, the digital moribund state of languages is accelerated by the lack of intuitive and useful text input methods for many minority and under-resourced languages. Even if text input methods currently exist for a language, it is often the case that they are disruptive (rather than smooth) to the digital text production process, due to inadequately optimized keyboards. This disruption then serves as a barrier to creating vibrant digital communities using these under-resourced languages. What is observed is that users of under-resourced languages often choose to use another language in digital contexts rather than deal with the disruptions of awkward keyboard input requirements. This actually serves to accelerate and solidify the under-resourced language in its moribund “vitality” state.
Optimized Keyboard Layouts are an academic pursuit in applied mathematics and computer science which intend to make keyboards intuitive and useful. Despite being language-related resources, keyboards and text input methods are rarely mentioned in the language development literature.
Within the computer science literature Yin and Su (2011) situate the optimization of the keyboard in a context known as the general keyboard arrangement problem (GKAP). Their work is well respected, but does not take into account several issues common to the minority-language context, such as keyboards with deadkey interactions, graphemic complexities (such as diacritic usage), and embedded linguistic knowledge (such as tone patterns, or multi-graph functional units). For example, Bi et al. (2012) look at the efficiency of text input with the deadkey method for diacritics, and contrast that with a single keystroke for a “composed” character. They conclude that the deadkey method is more efficient, but they only run their tests on European languages with orthographies that have a diacritic to total character density of less than 4%. Commonly, European languages use diacritics to indicate vowel quality. In contrast, many languages use diacritics to show tone patterns. In preliminary counts of minority-languages in both Mexico and Nigeria, I have encountered diacritic densities of over 30%. This means the extra time and effort it takes to use deadkeys is much more significant in these languages.
Paterson (2014) lays a foundation for the kinds of issues encountered by minority-languages typists, as an appeal to creators of resources for under-resourced languages to use design principles (Vitsœ 2012, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services 2018) in the creation of their language resource products. There, I argue that better design of text input solutions, which take into account linguistic knowledge about a language’s orthography, will increase the opportunities for digital vitality in an under-resourced language.  It does not, however, present a methodology for assessing the disruptive nature of a text input solution, so we still lack a metric for comparing the relative ease of typing on any given keyboard layout for a given language.
There currently does not exist a principled way to evaluate the utility or the application of User Experience principles (Garrett 2002) and design criteria to keyboard layouts. Researchers who have published on the keyboard optimization problem generally evaluate keyboard layouts on the basis of a composite “fitness score”. These scores only take into account the metrics of a single language - generally English - and only do it from an ergonomic perspective. As researchers in the field of language development, we are effectively blind when it comes to our ability to compare efficiency of two proposed keyboard layouts serving the same language,. A good framework does not exist for allowing researchers to ask the question: does QWERTY serve English users equally as well as AWERZY does to French users? - or any number of keyboards and their corresponding minority-languages.
Language development practitioners and linguists working in many different languages have created many keyboard layouts.  However, linguists have not adequately accounted for the linguistic dissonance between the psycholinguistic and phonemic realities of a spoken language and a speaker’s experience in typing that language. This has created a gap between the “possible to write/type” orthography and the “easy to write/type” orthography.
The general keyboard arrangement problem (GKAP) has been situated as a time over distance problem, i.e., speed. The assumption has been that if fingers travel a smaller distance, then faster typing should be the result. A secondary argument to increase speed has been to reduce effort. The assessment of effort has been tied to Fitts’ law (MacKenzie 1992) for measurements of physical effort. However, mental effort or user-perceived effort remains unassessed.
By visualizing keystrokes, we can identify the locus of impact in any given language. In language development work it is often the case that low-usage keys in an English-QWERTY layout are replaced with “new characters” to form keyboard layouts. The consequence has been the placement of frequently used keys under weak fingers, as demonstrated by the Meꞌphaa keyboard layout below. Notice the high frequency red(dish) areas and the lower frequency blue areas. These red areas would normally be struck with the pinky fingers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://hughandbecky.us/Hugh-CV/post/a-text-input-analysis-framework/Heatmaps-of-4-keyboards/%5Btcf%5D-heatmap-with-sample-text.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Meꞌphaa Keyboard&#34; title=&#34;Meꞌphaa Keyboard&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;p style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;Figure 1: Meꞌphaa Keyboard&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spanish, distributes the same amount of information across multiple fingers as shown in Figure 2 below. According to current keyboard layout theory even the Spanish keyboard is heavy on the weaker fingers of the left hand, but at least is better than the Meꞌphaa layout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://hughandbecky.us/Hugh-CV/post/a-text-input-analysis-framework/Heatmaps-of-4-keyboards/%5Bspa%5D-heatmap-with-full-text.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Spanish Keyboard&#34; title=&#34;Spanish Keyboard&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;p style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;Figure 2: Spanish Keyboard&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contrasting these two languages allows us to visualize how they are different with respect to the actions of the pinky finger. It also demonstrates how the attempt to ‘conserve QWERTY’ impacts typing in minority languages. Notice how the Meꞌphaa keyboard layout replaces the Spanish〈ç〉character with a tone diacritic key. Also note that these tone diacritics are very frequent in Meꞌphaa, and create a typing imbalance. Additionally, the Meꞌphaa Saltillo〈ꞌ〉 key is also on the right side with heavy use, further contributing to the typing imbalance.
These diagrams demonstrate the part of the keyboard layout analysis that can be computed using existing GKAP methods. What linguists bring to the discussion is an awareness of linguistic components. Orthographies are not just Unicode characters, but are functional units. The encoding of a functional unit can change from orthography to orthography. This is missed by many GKAP researchers. One needs to look beyond Unicode characters and toward ratios of keystrokes to functional units.
One way that linguists look at functional units differently than “pure technologists” is in the area of tone. Snider (2014) and Hyman (2014) both argue for an analysis of tone that looks at patterns across the domain of tonal attachment (usually the word or morpheme) rather than the more structuralist and segmental view of “letter plus pitch” which is the encoding method that Unicode follows. The difference in behavior becomes clearer when we contrast reading diacritic tone marks with a language which does not use diacritical marking. Imagine the following example represents the same sentence in two different languages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://hughandbecky.us/Hugh-CV/post/a-text-input-analysis-framework/With-and-without-tone.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Tone and non-Tone marking&#34; title=&#34;Tone and non-Tone marking&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A tone pattern analysis (following Snider and Hyman) would suggest that we should understand the tonally marked sentence to represent the segmental and the suprasegmental tiers separately, something like the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://hughandbecky.us/Hugh-CV/post/a-text-input-analysis-framework/2018-thesis-proposal/High-low-pattern-over-tone-marks.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Marking representing tonal patterns or melodies&#34; title=&#34;Marking representing tonal patterns or melodies&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is observed, anecdotally, that many writers of tone languages parse the writing task into two activities, one for each tier of information. Usually the segmental tier is completed first and then the suprasegmental tier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://hughandbecky.us/Hugh-CV/post/a-text-input-analysis-framework/Reading-twice.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Reading twice&#34; title=&#34;Reading twice&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This makes the writing activity much like handwriting in the United States where we say: “don’t forget to dot your &amp;lsquo;i&amp;rsquo;s and cross your  ‘t’s. The writer first completes the segmental tier and then comes back across with a second pass and completes dots the ‘i’s and crosses the ‘t’s.
However, the nature of typing, and Unicode’s structural nature, requires typists to complete the text production task linearly by codepoint. This creates dissonance from what many language users find “natural”, requiring them to frequently alternate their attention between the two tiers, as shown by the up and down movement in the following diagram.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://hughandbecky.us/Hugh-CV/post/a-text-input-analysis-framework/Up-and-down-eye-movement.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Up and down eye movement&#34; title=&#34;Up and down eye movement&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal of this thesis will be to develop and apply metrics to keyboard layouts so that their ease of use can be analysed and compared. Some optimised keyboards in a few sample languages will also be presented. Preliminary testing of these ideas has been done on English [eng], Spanish [spa], Me’phaa [tcf], and Chinantec [cso], as mentioned in Paterson (2014) and work done with Nigerian languages in Paterson (2015) covering Ezza [eza], Bekwarra [bkv], Cishingini [asg], Okphela [atg], and Igbo [ibo]. However, for this thesis I anticipate focusing on the three following languages: Navajo [nav], Kabiyè [kbp], and Eastern Dan [dnj], and especially the latter two, as they are related languages with very different design decisions in their orthographies, and both have very clear analysis of their tonal systems. This should allow observations about the typing process in one language to be contrasted with another related language. Further, there is a reasonable amount of text to work with in each language. Ultimately the final languages used will depend on the accessibility of corpora content in those languages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This thesis will add to the current GKAP discussion by proposing a theoretical framework and a two-metric algorithm that can be applied to any keyboard layout for any language using a Latin based script. The first metric will account for disruption in the phoneme (or functional unit) stream while engaged in typing, and the second will account for non-character-producing keystrokes, thus addressing the major problem areas outlined above. These metrics will then be combined with a haptic fitness score to produce a fitness score which accounts for linguistic knowledge. This thesis will contribute to the ongoing language development discussion by providing a quality assessment metric for the evaluation of a very important language-based digital product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;research-questions&#34;&gt;Research questions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem to be addressed can be expressed informally like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We have these keyboards layouts in all these languages, but they are not being used, and in general people find it easier to type in languages other than their mother tongue.  To what extent are our keyboards disruptive and thereby impeding language use in digital contexts? Can we measure the disruption?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More precisely, the following sub-questions can be addressed in the course of this investigation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What percentage of extra work is required to type minority-language texts?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, the “extra work” measurement might be measured in terms of the distance traveled, the time required to travel that distance, and the number of keystrokes, as compared between a language of wider communication and a minority language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a given language, what is the added unnecessary distance when typing text?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What are some common traits of excessive use/difficulty in text input keyboards for minority languages, and how can those commonalities of “pain”, be generalized for designers to avoid?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do we account for functional units (e.g. phonemes and tones) independent from character optimization? That is, does optimizing for character input also optimize for functional unit input?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can we predict that with tone languages we will exceed the Hick’s law minimum, whereas in non-tonal languages we can stay under Hick’s law?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hick’s law (Hick 1952) is a reference to how performance decreases as temporary memory functions increase, i.e., when we need to hold information in our temporary memory. This can be calculated on the basis of how many characters does one need to type in between the elements of a diacritic digraph.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How can we measure the dissonance factor for a particular keyboard layout? That is, how much dissonance does a keyboard layout solution induce?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dissonance is the cognitively difficult, or non-prefered choices that we must make to achieve the desired results. Dissonance is increased by those things which militate  against fluidity, and includes factors such as non-correspondence between keystrokes and functional units, the elements of a digraph, and multiple keystrokes per orthographic character.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;project-specifics&#34;&gt;Project specifics&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To perform the supporting analysis I will use existing texts to form a “corpus of keystrokes” and a “corpus of functional units”. I use the corpus of texts in conjunction with the existing keyboard layout to suggest what the “keystrokes required” would have been to produce a text (assuming 100% accuracy). Given that I am working with corpora, rather than original production data, I will not have actual time-over-distance measurements. I will rather, as is the norm for working with corpora in this context, infer the time to completion for each keystroke based on previously published experiments which show the time it takes to move a finger from one key to another. Then I will look at the functional units and measure (1) how many keystrokes to functional units are required, and (2) how much dissonance is created in the process of typing.
Existing keyboard layouts for the languages of the texts in question will be analysed, and scored. Finally, improved keyboard layouts with better scores will be suggested.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the process of doing research for the paper &amp;ldquo;Copyright and the distributed Lexicon. I started to realize that one very useful tool would be to have a refernece for copyright terms and scope related to a national framework where an indegious community might be located.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally there are other legal issues to consider when doing language research work. These also need to be researchable and associated with languages for those looking to do language research work. This project seeks to make such resources more easily discoverable.&lt;/p&gt;

      <guid>https://hughandbecky.us/Hugh-CV/post/linguistic-service-policies/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Working in services design and web-data handeling, I see a lot of different policies and data handling practices. However should there some special set of practices related to language data? I am exploring this question in a github repository. More specifically, services are an increasing component of today&amp;rsquo;s 21st century economy. Data services are more common and important to social function than ever before. This has impacts on academics doing research in linguistics and also impacts minority language users and communities of users who care about &amp;ldquo;their data&amp;rdquo;. This should challenge potential service providers to consider the following questions: What should Linguistic Services Policies look like? and What kinds of things should they cover? Founders of new services focusing on linguistics, language, and cultural heritage oriented data interactions and transactions may be aware of data concerns from a legal framework (within a certain country) point of view, but, they may be unfamiliar with data concerns as viewed by the community. While the concerns of minority language using communities may not be well known to businesses familiar with data handling procedures, these practices are often known to linguists working in and with communities of minority language users. An additional layer of complexity is that in many cases service users in minority language communities, may not understand the possible data protection rights available to them, or why they may need additional rights in digital contexts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The purpose of this study was to develop a curriculum for ethnomusicological education in Nigerian elementary schools based on the integration of ethnomusicology and social studies. The aims of the curriculum were identified so as to be consistent with the aims of the Nigerian education system and in particular with the recently expressed aims of the Nigerian social studies curriculum which is intended to foster inter- and cross-ethnic communication and understanding and national identity in a country which contains more than 250 ethnic groups. A consideration of appropriate curriculum content led to the identification of five basic concepts in ethnomusicology and five concepts basic to social studies. The integration of these concepts into a unified curriculum was made through an Identity Approach which permitted the identification of relevant cognitive, affective and skill objectives and indicated appropriate learning processes. Three curriculum units were developed in detail and field tested in upper elementary classes in two elementary schools in southeastern Nigeria. This field testing—the classroom phase of the curriculum development— involved 120 students, ten teachers and the administrators of the schools. The staff were given instruction in the curriculum materials and the Identity Approach following which the students were engaged in twenty-four sessions and covered the three units which had been developed. The results of the classroom phase were studied from students&amp;rsquo;, teachers&amp;rsquo; and administrators&amp;rsquo; opinions and recommendations and their responses to four opinionaires. All responses indicated a high degree of student interest in the project and evidence of an increase in inter-and cross-ethnic understanding and respect. Teachers found the project to have contributed to their professional development and both teachers and administrators reported community interest and involvement. Problems identified by the staff and administrators related to inadequate funds and provision of materials or equipment. Administrators also noted the need for involvement by the Ministry of Education if widespread implementation were to be contemplated.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The OWL and the Rice Farmer</title>
      <link>https://hughandbecky.us/Hugh-CV/post/the-owl-and-the-rice-farmer/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 04 Jun 2014 14:14:38 -0700</pubDate>
      <guid>https://hughandbecky.us/Hugh-CV/post/the-owl-and-the-rice-farmer/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In a recent email I was asked by a &lt;em&gt;European Linguistic Professional SIL Colleague&lt;/em&gt; about the ease of use of 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://archive.mpi.nl/tla/elan&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;ELAN&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is ELAN easy enough to use, so that an Indonesian rice farmer can use it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am offended with the &amp;lsquo;rice farmer&amp;rsquo; terminology which is prevalent in SIL discourse. However, to understand this term, and its usage I think it is important to understand another term used prior to &lt;em&gt;the rice farmer&lt;/em&gt; — &lt;em&gt;The Ordinary Working Linguist&lt;/em&gt;. This older phrase has gained some traction as evidenced by its adoption in the linguistic literature&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;,&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;,&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;,&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;,&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:5&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:5&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;,&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:6&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:6&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;,&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:7&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:7&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;,&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:8&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:8&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The OWL&lt;/em&gt; or &amp;lsquo;ordinary working linguist&amp;rsquo; is attributed 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.icsi.berkeley.edu/icsi/blog/chuck-fillmore-dies-at-84&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;by George Lakoff&lt;/a&gt; to Charles Fillmore as a self-describing term. Though it is impossible to say if Fillmore actually coined the term. If he did, then it is an interesting frame by the discoverer of cognitive framing. I have yet to meet an &lt;em&gt;ordinary linguist&lt;/em&gt;. I have met smart linguists, extraordinary linguists, novel linguists, quirky linguists, geeky linguists, and ornery linguists — but never an &lt;em&gt;ordinary one&lt;/em&gt;. The second issue I take with this contrived frame is that it suggests that somewhere there might be a &lt;em&gt;non-working linguist&lt;/em&gt;. Now, either I have never met a lazy linguist, or I have been foiled by some collective endeavor. That is, the linguists I have met have somehow &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; decided that I am an extremely boring person — the kind to be avoided, and &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; have feigned busyness! Granted busyness is not the same as &amp;ldquo;working&amp;rdquo;, but I have never met a linguist who is not engaged in some sort of activity which has a mistakable similitude to &lt;em&gt;work&lt;/em&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the same, the notion of &amp;ldquo;OWL&amp;rdquo; seems to be very useful to a large group of linguists. For instance, 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://scholars.sil.org/gary_f_simons/preprint/computing_environment&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Gary F. Simons suggests&lt;/a&gt; that Helen Aristar Dry proposed a book in the early 1990s with the title &lt;em&gt;Computers and the Ordinary Working Linguist.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:9&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:9&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, While David Nathan, Peter Austin, Andrew Black, Piotr Bański, Mike Cahill, Jeff Good, Steven Moran, Scott Farrar, and René van den Berg all use the term in their works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In honor of Fillmore, if we take a framing view of the phrase &amp;ldquo;ordinary working linguist&amp;rdquo; we can see that many of the authors are discussing the concept within the frame of linguistic computing — the computer tools that linguists use to do their work. However, it can be argued that there is an SIL specific shift in the framing of the phrase (usage by Cahill, Schroeder, Simons, Black, and van den Berg). Van den Berg&amp;rsquo;s use is most articulate:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the typical SIL fieldworker is what has been called an ‘owl’, that is, an ‘ordinary working linguist’ who has been given enough training to enable him or her to do the job; this  is usually a minimum of  two semesters of field linguistics at graduate level. A typical SIL field worker is therefore very  much a generalist, without specialist knowledge in any branch of linguistics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Van den Berg&amp;rsquo;s usage is both confirmed and then contrasted by 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20130308204655/https://www.sil.org/linguistics/people&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;SIL International&lt;/a&gt; on its website where it contrasts the term with &lt;em&gt;Linguistics Coordinators&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Linguistics Consultants&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;International Linguistics Advisors&lt;/em&gt;. It is clear to see that within the shared frame by SIL staff, that Linguistic Consultants are those who have more training than typical SIL field workers. For several reasons, including reduced staffing, and paradigm shifts within project management related moral ownership within the tasks of language development, SIL has moved from ex-pat driven projects to nationally staffed and ethnolinguistic community driven projects. SIL&amp;rsquo;s minimally trained &amp;ldquo;OWLs&amp;rdquo; moved up the organizational chart to become project managers/facilitators, leaving open the &amp;ldquo;bottom&amp;rdquo; of the chart, ergo the new need for &amp;lsquo;rice farmer&amp;rsquo; as a newly perceived class of computer user.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I find the term &lt;em&gt;rice farmer&lt;/em&gt; 14 times in the internal SIL International wiki and I find &amp;ldquo;OWL&amp;rdquo; 83 times. These terms surface mostly among SIL computer app developers, but I also hear them used by SIL policy and procedures developers, SIL program planners, and SIL educators. To me this term comes off as a class distinction term (and maybe there is nothing wrong with class distinction; I mean the Jews had class distinctions at the time of Jesus, the Cretans had classes at the time of Titus, the British have it, and castes are alive and well in India, etc.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:10&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:10&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;). However, as I find the term being used in SIL, a more transparent term might be &amp;lsquo;low socio-economic and low educational &lt;em&gt;capacity&lt;/em&gt; individual&amp;rsquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem is that in my work with Steve Marlett in Mexico, I worked with ethnolinguistic moronity language users who were not &amp;lsquo;low educational capacity individuals&amp;rsquo; rather they were high educational capacity individuals. When I went to Malaysia and worked with Sean Conklin, the same thing, ethnolinguistic minority language users were not low educational capacity individuals. When I went to Nigeria and worked with people like Becky Paterson and David Rowbory, the people doing language work with us were not low educational capacity individuals. In fact the Nigerian rice farmer/pastor/student/translator/cultural guide/language activist who was on our language project team can and does use ELAN after some training (and uses Facebook without training to boot — FYI: I need training on ELAN too!). So, why then do SIL staff use terms like &amp;lsquo;rice farmers&amp;rsquo; when they talk about designing software for users? Something seems to be wrong with this picture. My guess is that there is a real reason why SIL staff use the term, but it is not the reason that SIL staff attribute as the causation of the observation of &amp;ldquo;low educational capacity individuals&amp;rdquo; - as we observe dark skinned colleagues who try and use SIL software and don&amp;rsquo;t intuitively know how to use the tools. My guess is that the reason for the use of the term is because it is part of the SIL corporate ethos. SIL staff use (or at least have in the past) their educational courses at various SIL training events as filters to find the &amp;lsquo;best and brightest students&amp;rsquo; and recommend those for various field service within SIL. Then in the advanced classes SIL staff obfuscate the materials just to make them harder, to see if those same students are able to still keep up. So, as I see it, there seems to be this undefined class difference in SIL&amp;rsquo;s corporate sociology preferring those who can distill obfuscated communications under stress and dis-preferring those who cannot distill obfuscated signals under stress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So for the following four reasons I strongly dis-prefer the terms &amp;lsquo;rice farmer&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;OWL&amp;rsquo; as they often appear in SIL discourse:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t think the &amp;lsquo;rice farmer&amp;rsquo; terminology is actually very useful for professional reasons. Software design is about communicating. It is about communicating relational concepts in a visual context. It is about connecting new analogies with salient concepts. User Interface (UI - what a software user sees and interacts with) is the gateway to User Experience (UX - the emotional, logical, task based context of activities that are attempting to be facilitated by the software designer and accomplished by the software user). Therefore what UX is really about is communicating ideas and creating positive and successful interactions. If the UI fails to create the designed UX then it doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter if the user is a rice farmer or a Ph.D. candidate from an Australian university. The end result is that the user is frustrated and will not use the software willingly. Therefore, singling out the &amp;lsquo;rice farmer&amp;rsquo; from the white guy is not really a useful construct because all users, whether black, white, tan, farmer, or stockbroker, are subject to the same constraints and frustrations of software which is not intuitively implemented. It is my experience that programmers (not just SIL programmers) usually do not intuitively know how application users think or behave. UX design is an art and a science that takes experimentation and a solid grasp of information design principles.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s not forget that, at least in software design we are talking about the &amp;lsquo;rice farmer&amp;rsquo; with a computer, an iPad, or an android device.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We never use the American Corn Farmer, or the Norwegian Reindeer Rancher as analogies, and I am a bit tired of singling out people from tropical areas because their skin is darker, or their average height is shorter, or because they grow rice in their backyard. The focus on the &amp;lsquo;rice farmer&amp;rsquo; does not help us deal with the white guy&amp;rsquo;s problem with the software and robs us of a balanced view of the real communication challenge.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using the term &amp;lsquo;rice farmer&amp;rsquo; seems to put the ethnolinguistic minority language users and nationals in a sub-standard class relative to &amp;lsquo;real linguists&amp;rsquo; or &amp;lsquo;real missionaries&amp;rsquo;. Yes, my African colleagues who do have their own farms and families, also use SIL software; I first drove a tractor at age 13 and grew up on a farm, so what is the difference? By making the &amp;lsquo;OWL&amp;rsquo; or the &amp;lsquo;rice farmer&amp;rsquo; as some uninitiated or limited capacity person,  the &amp;ldquo;reason&amp;rdquo; for new design (i.e the reason that 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://software.sil.org/wesay&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;WeSay&lt;/a&gt; was created to work with 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://software.sil.org/fieldworks&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;FLEx&lt;/a&gt;) doesn&amp;rsquo;t solve the fact that even for highly-educated-white-professionals FLEx is still confusing. The issue is a visual communications issue not a smarts or intelligence issue. Linguistic concepts can be communicated about beautifully and communicated simply, both in the classroom and in software. &lt;!-- also note the framing that John Hatton has taken about PhD in having training for software but nations don&#39;t in his presentation  on SayMore here: https://scholarspace.manoa.hawaii.edu/handle/10125/26153?mode=full --&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope this post motivates those in SIL to take a deeper look at User Experience issues in the software tools and websites we build.&lt;/p&gt;

      <pubDate>Sat, 13 Jul 2013 14:35:45 +0100</pubDate>
      <guid>https://hughandbecky.us/Hugh-CV/post/mass-import-to-endnote/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This summer (June-August) I added 629 new citation to 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://endnote.com&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;EndNote&lt;/a&gt; - mostly by hand. Of those citation 392 of them had PDFs attached to the citation. I am ready to learn how to more effectively use EndNote. I estimate that I still have 450 PDFs in various folders from courses and research trips to the library over the last few years that I need to add to EndNote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I usually try and download &lt;code&gt;.ris&lt;/code&gt; files when I find a resource I want to reference or use. The problem I have is that EndNote X6 does not allow for importing more than one &lt;code&gt;.ris&lt;/code&gt; file at a time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To speed up the process I have learned to use the OS X Concatenate command in terminal: &lt;code&gt;cat&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I open up terminal. Type &lt;code&gt;cd&lt;/code&gt; drag my folder containing the &lt;code&gt;.ris&lt;/code&gt; files I want to add to EndNote over the blinking cursor and hit enter. I then type &lt;code&gt;cat&lt;/code&gt; and drag all the &lt;code&gt;.ris&lt;/code&gt; files I want to concatenate to one &lt;code&gt;.ris&lt;/code&gt; file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;


&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Type a &lt;code&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; symbol and the new &lt;code&gt;.ris&lt;/code&gt; file&amp;rsquo;s name. The result is a concatenation of all the data from the many &lt;code&gt;.ris&lt;/code&gt; files into one &lt;code&gt;.ris&lt;/code&gt; file. This allows me to go back to EndNote and import all the one massive &lt;code&gt;.ris&lt;/code&gt; file and save clicks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One can also use the star/wildcard character like this &lt;code&gt;$ cat *.ris &amp;gt; new.ris&lt;/code&gt;. This will concatenate all the .ris files within the folder into the &lt;code&gt;new.ris&lt;/code&gt; file.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Curation workflow networks at the Language &amp; Culture Archives</title>
      <link>https://hughandbecky.us/Hugh-CV/post/lca-curation-workflow-network/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 23 May 2013 14:35:45 +0100</pubDate>
      <guid>https://hughandbecky.us/Hugh-CV/post/lca-curation-workflow-network/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This network diagram shows the flow of resources curated by different curator for different collections at the Language &amp;amp; Culture Archives. Clearly some curators are busier than others, and some collections recive more submissions. The network graph was created using 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://gephi.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Gephi&lt;/a&gt;. This particular graph did not make it into the Hawaiʻi version of the poster, 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://hughandbecky.us/Hugh-CV/publication/2013-challenges-ramp/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;but did make it into the UND version of the poster&lt;/a&gt;. If I were to try and visualize this data again I might try and use a 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sankey_diagram&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Sankey diagram&lt;/a&gt;. I would seperate out submissions (by file), curators (by person), and collections.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Audio Dominant Texts and Text Dominant Audio</title>
      <link>https://hughandbecky.us/Hugh-CV/post/audio-dominant-texts-and-text-dominant-audio/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 18 Mar 2013 14:35:45 +0100</pubDate>
      <guid>https://hughandbecky.us/Hugh-CV/post/audio-dominant-texts-and-text-dominant-audio/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;As linguistics and language documentation interface with digital humanities there has been a lot of effort to time-align texts and audio/video materials. At one level this is rather trivial to do and has the backing of comercial media processes like subtitles in movies. However, at another level this task is often done in XML for every project (digital corpus curation) slightly differently. At the macro-scale the argument is that if the annotation of the audio is in XML and someone wants to do something else with it, then they can just convert the XML to whatever schema they desire. This is true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, one antidotal point that I have not heard in discussion of time aligned texts is specifications for Audio Dominant Text vs. Text Dominant Audio. This may not initially seem very important, so let me explain what I mean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;audio-dominant-text&#34;&gt;Audio Dominant Text&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are those texts which were first captured orally. They are a performance. The content may be prepared (in the sense of the telling of a traditional epic), but they are not read texts. They are given from memory. The text lives. In terms of time aligned transcription, from this performance is transcribed. This oral text type stands in contrast to the &lt;em&gt;Text Dominant Audio&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;text-dominant-audio&#34;&gt;Text Dominant Audio&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Text dominant audio is where a text is read, scripted or prompted. Several examples of this exist, a radio drama, a cartoon/animated film, a reading. In linguistics a wordlist would also classify. The guiding principle is &lt;em&gt;What is guiding the audio?&lt;/em&gt; Is it the structure of the text based document or is it the image of the oral segment as it comes to the speaker spontaneously without visual or interactive reliance?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This difference should be noted in metadata durring oral text collection durring language documentation projects. In one project I was involved in, several speakers were recored who were reading texts which they had composed, written and typed. Some editorial help was provided by the PI on some of the texts. These texts now exist as both oral and written texts (in terms of modality). But is the written form a transcription? I doubt it. It is like the inverse of a transcription. The oral but these texts can be presented online similarly to Nick Thieberger’s presentation of text through EOPAS. Example: &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.eopas.org/transcripts/65&#34;&gt;http://www.eopas.org/transcripts/65&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess in terms of XML, my outstanding question is: &lt;em&gt;How should the structure be represented?&lt;/em&gt; If the reading is only a reading, then should the text be head in the XML document and the audio matched to that? Obviously some would say that even readings are performances and I do agree to an extent. However, even with these performances because the non-spontaneous nature of the delivery, and the previous editing of the text, is there a smoothing out of the text which might be equivalent to removing dialectical syntactic variation?&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The SIL archive and its two sided markets</title>
      <link>https://hughandbecky.us/Hugh-CV/post/the-sil-archive-and-its-two-sided-markets/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 03 Feb 2013 01:41:38 -0700</pubDate>
      <guid>https://hughandbecky.us/Hugh-CV/post/the-sil-archive-and-its-two-sided-markets/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have been thinking about the language data marketplace (exchange if one prefers), and the role of archives in a world where minority language speakers are also internet users and digital file consumers. In particular I have been thinking about 
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.sil.org/resources/language-culture-archives&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;SIL’s Language and Culture Archive&lt;/a&gt; and the economic model called a 
&lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-sided_market&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;two sided market&lt;/a&gt;. So, SIL as “Partners in Language Development” seems to be well situated for analysis using the two sided market analysis (matching linguist and professionals with language development skills, and persons with language development skills with interested parties in developing their language). On the surface, it seems that the SIL archive would also benefit from being the center of exchange between these same two groups. This is the subject of one of my slides for 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://hughandbecky.us/Hugh-CV/publication/2013-challenges-ramp&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;an upcoming presentation&lt;/a&gt;, therefore I sketched out the interactions various SIL staff might have with the archive to see if I could diagram the social interactions around language data in SIL’s two sided market. To my surprise, the two sided nature of access to data in the archive is not supported, thereby blocking a data-centric archiving service. It makes me wonder what the perceived value of the archive really is, and if the perceived value is low, then why bother? What is the return on investment (ROI) for users on either side of the market?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tried to summarize the relationships between the various clients of the archive in the following image.
&lt;img src=&#34;https://hughandbecky.us/Hugh-CV/post/the-sil-archive-and-its-two-sided-markets/SIL-Archive-and-its-two-sided-markets.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;SIL Archive and its two multi-sided market representation&#34; title=&#34;SIL Archive and its two multi-sided market representation&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>SEO Considerations for Linguistic Resources</title>
      <link>https://hughandbecky.us/Hugh-CV/post/seo-considerations-for-linguistic-resources/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 19 Feb 2012 14:35:45 +0100</pubDate>
      <guid>https://hughandbecky.us/Hugh-CV/post/seo-considerations-for-linguistic-resources/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;SEO for standard websites is pretty straight forward. I happen to be working on a website redesign (in Drupal) which presents Linguistic resources both published and unpublished. I recently came across two specialized SEO options which are useful:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Integration with Google Scholar&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Aggregation with 
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.language-archives.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;OLAC&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;google-scholar&#34;&gt;Google Scholar&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google Scholar’s page on getting data into Google Scholar: &lt;a href=&#34;http://scholar.google.com/intl/en/scholar/inclusion.html&#34;&gt;http://scholar.google.com/intl/en/scholar/inclusion.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;http://drupal.org/project/biblio&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Biblo&lt;/a&gt;, a module for drupal which handles bibliographic data had something 
&lt;a href=&#34;http://drupal.org/node/641580&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This blog also has an interesting write up: &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.reallywow.com/archives/123&#34;&gt;http://blog.reallywow.com/archives/123&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;olac-search&#34;&gt;OLAC Search&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This means implementing the 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.openarchives.org/pmh/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;OAI-PMH protocol&lt;/a&gt; so that OLAC can harvest it.
I am not sure how this is done exactly… but here is the link: &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.language-archives.org/&#34;&gt;http://www.language-archives.org/&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Using EndNote X4 for Mac</title>
      <link>https://hughandbecky.us/Hugh-CV/post/using-endnote-x4-for-mac/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 10 Feb 2011 14:35:45 +0100</pubDate>
      <guid>https://hughandbecky.us/Hugh-CV/post/using-endnote-x4-for-mac/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the most popular Citation Management software applications among academics is the application &lt;em&gt;EndNote&lt;/em&gt;. 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://endnote.com&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;EndNote&lt;/a&gt; has a long history is published by a reputable company, and has some pretty cool features. I use it (version X4) primarily because it is the only citation software&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; which integrates natively with the word processor &lt;em&gt;Pages&lt;/em&gt;, by Apple, Inc. The software boasts a bit of flexibility and quite a few useful features. Some of the really useful features I use are below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Customizing the output style of the bibliographies.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Looking for PDF files.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Attaching additional meta-data to each citation. (Like ISO 639-3 Language Codes)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Adding additional types of resources like 
&lt;a href=&#34;http://roa.rutgers.edu/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Rutgers Optimality Archive&lt;/a&gt; Documents with an ROA number.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Smart Groups of files based on desired criteria.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Integration with Apple&amp;rsquo;s word processor Pages.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Research Notes section in the citation&amp;rsquo;s file for creating an annotated bibliography.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Copy our all the selected works, so that they can be pasted as a bibliography in another document.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;XML Output of Citation Data&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The XML Support of Endnote has not been hailed as the greatest implementation of XML but there are tools out there to work with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.uns.ethz.ch/pub/publications/xml_format&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.uns.ethz.ch/pub/publications/xml_format&#34;&gt;http://www.uns.ethz.ch/pub/publications/xml_format&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.thau-knudsen.dk/weblog/pmachine/it-weblog_comments.php?id=59_0_2_0_C&#34;&gt;XSL Transformation stylesheet for EndNote XML&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, regardless of how many good features I find and use in Endnote there are several things about it which irk me to no end. This is sort of a laundry list of these problematic areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;del datetime=&#34;2011-03-01T04:15:36+00:00&#34;&gt;Can not sort by resource type&lt;/del&gt;:
&lt;em&gt;For instance if I wanted to sort or create a smart list of all my Book references, or just Journal Articles.&lt;/em&gt; This can be done, one just has to create a smart list and then set &lt;em&gt;Reference Type&lt;/em&gt; to &lt;em&gt;Contains&lt;/em&gt;: &amp;ldquo;Book Section&amp;rdquo;. There is not a drop down list of reference types invoked by the user.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;del datetime=&#34;2011-02-24T16:23:52+00:00&#34;&gt;Can not sort by custom field&lt;/del&gt;:
&lt;em&gt;I think you can do this in the interface. Though it was not obvious on how to do it.&lt;/em&gt; 







  



  
  
















&lt;figure id=&#34;figure-endnote-display-fields&#34;&gt;


  &lt;a data-fancybox=&#34;&#34; href=&#34;https://hughandbecky.us/Hugh-CV/Hugh-CV/post/using-endnote-x4-for-mac/Endnote_Display_Fields_hu6175e2e8318e865aaff9b1ae3a8c3023_108510_2000x2000_fit_q90_lanczos.jpg&#34; data-caption=&#34;Endnote Display Fields.&#34;&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;


&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can not view all the custom fields for a resource type across all resources.
&lt;em&gt;This seems to be limited to eight fileds in the sorting viewer at a time.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;del datetime=&#34;2011-02-24T16:23:52+00:00&#34;&gt;Can not view all entries without content in a specified field.&lt;/del&gt;
&lt;em&gt;This would be especially nice to create a smart list for this.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No exports of PDFs or exports of PDFs with &lt;code&gt;.ris&lt;/code&gt; files.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no keyboard short-cut to bring up the &lt;em&gt;Import function&lt;/em&gt; (or &lt;em&gt;Export&lt;/em&gt;) under &lt;strong&gt;File Menu&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does not rename PDFs based on metadata of the resource.
&lt;em&gt;This is possible with 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.papersapp.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Papers&lt;/a&gt; and 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.mendeley.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Mendeley&lt;/a&gt;. The user has the option to rename the file based on things like Author, Date of publication, etc.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can not create a smart list based on a constant in the Issue data part.
&lt;em&gt;I have Volume and Issue Data. Some of the citation data pulled in for some items has the issue set as 02, 03, etc. I want to be able to find all the issues which start with a zero so I can remove the zeros. Most stylesheets do not remove the zeros and also do not allow for them&lt;/em&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;Modifying  Resource type does not accept |Language| Subject Language|&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;del datetime=&#34;2011-02-24T16:23:52+00:00&#34;&gt;There is no guide in any of Endnote&amp;rsquo;s documentation for how to create an export style sheet.&lt;/del&gt;
This is in the Help Menus I was expecting it on the producers website or in a book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When editing an entry&amp;rsquo;s meta-data &lt;em&gt;i.e. the author, or the title of a work&lt;/em&gt;, pressing TAB does not move the cursor to the next field.
&lt;em&gt;At least some times it does not continue to TAB. If I do a new entry as a Journal article, then it will tab till the issue field, but not beyond. It gets stuck.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no LAN collaboration or sharing feature for a local network solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no Cloud based collaborative solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no way to create a smart group based off of a subset of items in a normal group.
i.e. I want to create a smart group of all the references with a PDF attached but I only want it to pull from the items in a particular group (or set of groups).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;li&gt;There is no PDF Preview within the application. The existing Preview is for seeing the current citation in the selected citation style. (Preview of the output.) It would be helpful if there was also a preview pane for viewing the PDF or the attached file.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are other citation management software for OS X which claims integration with Apple&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;Pages&lt;/em&gt; but none of these solutions are endorsed or supported by Apple. Some of the other applications which claim integration with &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.apple.com/iwork/pages/&#34;&gt;Pages&lt;/a&gt; are: 1) &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.thirdstreetsoftware.com/site/SenteBibliographies.html&#34;&gt;Sente&lt;/a&gt;, 2) &lt;a href=&#34;http://sonnysoftware.com/bookends/bookends.html&#34;&gt;Bookends&lt;/a&gt;, and 3) &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mekentosj.com&#34;&gt;Papers&lt;/a&gt; - This is &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_reference_management_software#Word_processor_integration&#34;&gt;according to Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;, but I own and use Papers 1.9.7 and have not seen how to integrate it with Pages. (However, Papers2, released March 8th, 2011 does say that it supports citation integration with Pages.). &lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li id=&#34;fn:2&#34; role=&#34;doc-endnote&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are several Linguistics Journals with style sheets on 
&lt;a href=&#34;http://endnote.com/downloads/styles&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;EndNote&amp;rsquo;s website&lt;/a&gt;. Among them are: Linguistic Inquiry, Journal of the International Phonetic Association, Phonology, Lingua, Journal of Phonetics, and Language. Additionally there is a version of the Unified Linguistics Style Sheet available for Endnote. This is available from Manchester UK. &lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20120829004722/http://www.llc.manchester.ac.uk/intranet/ug/useful-links/computing-resources/wordprocessing/&#34;&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20120829004722/http://www.llc.manchester.ac.uk/intranet/ug/useful-links/computing-resources/wordprocessing/&lt;/a&gt;.
