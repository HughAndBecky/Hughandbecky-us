		"abstract": "The roles of teachers in traditional second language classrooms are examined and measured against current conceptual trends within the discipline of foreign language learning and teaching. These trends, especially those in interpersonal communication and learner autonomy, require a new understanding of the classroom role of the language teacher. The Kanda English Language Proficiency (KELP) classroom at Kanda University (Japan) is then described; in this context, students assume responsibility for their own learning program. The teacher's role in this classroom is presented as an example of what the roles of foreign language teachers of the future might be. Implications for the future design of second language teacher training are also considered. (Contains 31 references.)  (MSE)",
