  {"id":"austin_language_2013","abstract":"\"Many of the world's languages have diminishing numbers of speakers and are in danger of falling silent. Around the globe, a large body of linguists are collaborating with members of indigenous communities to keep these languages alive. Mindful that their work will be used by future speech communities to learn, teach and revitalise their languages, scholars face new challenges in the way they gather materials and in the way they present their findings. This volume discusses current efforts to record, collect and archive endangered languages in traditional and new media that will support future language learners and speakers. Chapters are written by academics working in the field of language endangerment and also by indigenous people working 'at the coalface' of language support and maintenance. Keeping Languages Alive is a must-read for researchers in language documentation, language typology and linguistic anthropology\"--","author":[{"family":"Austin","given":"Peter K."}],"call-number":"P40.5.E53 K44 2013","container-title":"Keeping Languages Alive: Documentation, Pedagogy and Revitalization","DOI":"10.1017/CBO9781139245890.003","editor":[{"family":"Jones","given":"Mari C."},{"family":"Ogilvie","given":"Sarah"}],"event-place":"Cambridge, UK; New York","ISBN":"978-1-107-02906-4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2013]]},"language":"en","page":"3–15","publisher":"Cambridge University Press","publisher-place":"Cambridge, UK; New York","source":"Library of Congress ISBN","title":"Language documentation and meta-documentation","type":"chapter","URL":"http://ebooks.cambridge.org/ref/id/CBO9781139245890"},

The paper distinguishes among various ways that linguistic features can be distributed within and across texts; it analyses the distributions of several particular features, and it discusses the implications of these distributions for corpus design.","author":[{"family":"Biber","given":"Douglas"}],"container-title":"Literary and Linguistic Computing","DOI":"10.1093/llc/8.4.243","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[1993]]},"language":"en","page":"243–257","source":"Zotero","title":"Representativeness in Corpus Design","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://otipl.philol.msu.ru/media/biber930.pdf","volume":"8"},

  {"id":"boerger_boldly_2011","abstract":"In this article, I report on a survey designed as the first step in testing claims made regarding\nthe potential of Basic Oral Language Documentation (BOLD) for addressing the urgency\nof the documentation task. BOLD was developed in response to a number of language\ndocumentation challenges, its aim being to design a time-effective way to obtain a core\ndata corpus, thereby allowing for more endangered languages to be documented faster. After\nproviding background about BOLD and its claims, I report on its use in six field projects\nwhich had varying durations and goals. These preliminary results confirm BOLD’s overall\nsoundness, while suggesting minor adjustments in design and protocols. I invite the language\ndocumentation community to participate in BOLD in three ways: (1) make BOLD\ncorpora of undocumented languages a funding priority, (2) use it and require it of students,\nand (3) help refine BOLD best practices. Since the current rate of new documentations is\nnot keeping pace with language loss, it is only by adopting this or a similar strategy that\nspeech practices of communities around the world can be documented before it is too late.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,1,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Boerger","given":"Brenda"}],"container-title":"Language Documentation & Conservation","ISSN":"1934-5275","issued":{"date-parts":[[2011,12]]},"language":"eng","note":"Accepted: 2011-12-15T23:58:02Z","page":"208-233","publisher":"University of Hawai'i Press","source":"scholarspace.manoa.hawaii.edu","title":"To BOLDly Go Where No One Has Gone Before","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://scholarspace.manoa.hawaii.edu/handle/10125/4499","volume":"5"},

  {"id":"johnston_archive_2010","abstract":"Annotations are an important resource in corpus-based linguistic research. In fact, the most important feature of a modern signed language corpus should be that it has been annotated rather than simply transcribed. Digital multi-media annotation software can now transform language recordings into machinereadable texts using gloss-based annotations without it first being necessary to transcribe these utterances, provided that sign tokens are identified and discriminated according to type. Further annotations can subsequently be appended to these units. However, unique identifiers of sign types (or ‘ID-glosses’) can only be used if a comprehensive reference lexical database of the language already exists. In order to create a basic multi-purpose reference signed language corpus, therefore, linguists should prioritize annotation using ID-glosses above transcription. The effort expended in creating a transcription that does not facilitate the unique identification of sign types will not result in a machine-readable corpus in any meaningful sense, contrary to expectations.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,3,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Johnston","given":"Trevor"}],"container-title":"International Journal of Corpus Linguistics","container-title-short":"IJCL","DOI":"10.1075/ijcl.15.1.05joh","ISSN":"1384-6655, 1569-9811","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2010,4,6]]},"language":"en","page":"106-131","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"From archive to corpus: Transcription and annotation in the creation of signed language corpora","title-short":"From archive to corpus","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.jbe-platform.com/content/journals/10.1075/ijcl.15.1.05joh","volume":"15"},

  {"id":"manning_kirrkirr_2001","abstract":"This paper presents an overview of the goals, architecture, and usability of Kirrkirr, a Java-based visualization tool for XML dictionaries, currently being used with a dictionary for Warlpiri, an Australian Aboriginal language. It discusses the underlying lexicon structure, and shows how a computer interface can effectively select from and display that content in various ways. The views of the dictionary include a graph view, which shows a network of semantically related words, and a formatted text view that can be customized via XSLT stylesheets. The paper argues that indigenous language dictionaries have normally been written for linguists, while the educational needs of other users have not been adequately met. It discusses the strengths of a computer dictionary interface in providing more help to native speaker users than a conventional dictionary, but argues that the possibilities for the visualization of dictionary information on computers have so far been insufficiently exploited. The paper concludes by briefly discussing observational and task-based testing of the dictionary with native speakers and learners.","author":[{"family":"Manning","given":"Christopher D"},{"family":"Jansz","given":"Kevin"},{"family":"Indurkhya","given":"Nitin"}],"container-title":"Literary and Linguistic Computing","issued":{"date-parts":[[2001]]},"language":"en","page":"15","source":"Zotero","title":"Kirrkirr: Software for browsing and visual exploration of a structured Warlpiri dictionary","type":"article-journal"},
