  {"id":"roberts_tone_2011-1","abstract":"Discussions about tone orthography have long been hampered by imprecise terminology. This article aims to bring clarity by means of an explicit typology composed of six parameters. Each parameter is defined by a choice: domain, target, symbol, position, density, and depth. The orthographer assesses each typological aspect individually, while always bearing in mind that the six parameters together generate a complex matrix of responses. The result is a precise and informative character profile for any Roman script tone orthography.
