  {"id":"andreassen_tromso_2019-1","abstract":"Language and linguistics datasets are often not cited, or cited imprecisely, because of confusion surrounding the proper methods for citing them. For the use of researchers and scholars in the field working with datasets, we propose components of data citation for referencing language data, both in the bibliography and in the text of linguistics publications. \n\n \n\nThe intended audience for these recommendations consists of i) academic publishers, ii) resource providers (e.g. repositories, archives), iii) researchers citing data, and iv) researchers making data management plans, developing and depositing data, and preparing metadata. Academic publishers will have the opportunity to add these recommendations to their author guidelines for citation. Resource providers will learn which metadata and citation elements are crucial in order for data to be properly citable. Researchers using data in their publication will know how to cite these data in case publisher guidelines are underspecified. Researchers depositing data in a repository will know more about what metadata they should provide in order to publish their data so as to make them citable.\n\n \n\nAs each journal may have its own stylistic conventions, we do not address specific formats or citation styles, but rather elements of citations; however, for journals or repositories seeking to update their data citation guidance, we hope this document will be helpful. Furthermore, these recommendations are intended to be only guidelines, as we cannot account for every possibility here. This guidance is based on the Austin Principles, the FORCE11 and Research Data Alliance Joint Declaration of Data Citation Principles, and the Reproducible Research in Linguistics position statement.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",4,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Andreassen","given":"Helene N."},{"family":"Berez-Kroeker","given":"Andrea L."},{"family":"Collister","given":"Lauren"},{"family":"Conzett","given":"Philipp"},{"family":"Cox","given":"Christopher"},{"family":"Smedt","given":"Koenraad De"},{"family":"McDonnell","given":"Bradley"},{"family":"Cieri","given":"Chris"},{"family":"Coretta","given":"Stefano"},{"family":"De Smedt","given":"Koenraad"},{"family":"Ferrara","given":"Lindsay"},{"family":"Forkel","given":"Robert"},{"family":"Smythe Kung","given":"Susan"},{"family":"Lischinsky","given":"Alon"},{"family":"Nordhoff","given":"Sebastian"},{"family":"Paterson III","given":"Hugh J"},{"family":"Ring","given":"Hiram"},{"family":"Thieberger","given":"Nick"},{"family":"Winters","given":"Margaret E"}],"citation-key":"andreassen_tromso_2019-1","DOI":"10.15497/RDA00040","event-place":"Etterbeek, Belgium","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019"]]},"language":"en","license":"CC BY 4.0","publisher":"Research Data Alliance Linguistic Data Interest Group","publisher-place":"Etterbeek, Belgium","source":"DOI.org (Datacite)","title":"Tromsø recommendations for citation of research data in linguistics","type":"book","URL":"https://www.rd-alliance.org/group/linguistics-data-ig/outcomes/troms%C3%B8-recommendations-citation-research-data-linguistics"},
  {"id":"bird_olac_2001-4","abstract":"As language data and associated technologies proliferate and as the language resources community rapidly expands, it has become difficult to locate and reuse existing resources. Are there any lexical resources for such-and-such a language? What tool can work with transcripts in this particular format? What is a good format to use for linguistic data of this type? Questions like these dominate many mailing lists, since web search engines are an unreliable way to find language resources. This paper describes a new digital infrastructure for language resource discovery, based on the Open Archives Initiative, and called OLAC -- the Open Language Archives Community. The OLAC Metadata Set and the associated controlled vocabularies facilitate consistent description and focussed searching. We report progress on the metadata set and controlled vocabularies, describing current issues and soliciting input from the language resources community.","archive":"ACL Anthology","author":[{"family":"Bird","given":"Steven"},{"family":"Simons","given":"Gary F."}],"citation-key":"bird_olac_2001-4","container-title":"Proceedings of ACL/EACL Workshop on Sharing Tools and Resources for Research and Education","editor":[{"family":"DeClerck","given":"Thierry"},{"family":"Krauwer","given":"Steven"},{"family":"Rosner","given":"Mike"}],"event-place":"Université de Toulouse, France","issued":{"date-parts":[["2001"]]},"language":"English","page":"7–18","publisher":"EACL-ACL; elsnet","publisher-place":"Université de Toulouse, France","title":"The OLAC metadata set and controlled vocabularies","type":"chapter","URL":"https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/W01-1506"},
