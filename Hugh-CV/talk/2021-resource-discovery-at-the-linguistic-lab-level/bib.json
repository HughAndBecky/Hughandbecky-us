  {"id":"arlitsch_invisible_2012","abstract":"Purpose – Google Scholar has difﬁculty indexing the contents of institutional repositories, and the authors hypothesize the reason is that most repositories use Dublin Core, which cannot express bibliographic citation information adequately for academic papers. Google Scholar makes speciﬁc recommendations for repositories, including the use of publishing industry metadata schemas over Dublin Core. This paper aims to test a theory that transforming metadata schemas in institutional repositories will lead to increased indexing by Google Scholar.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,5,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Arlitsch","given":"Kenning"},{"family":"O'Brien","given":"Patrick S."}],"container-title":"Library Hi Tech","container-title-short":"Library Hi Tech","DOI":"10.1108/07378831211213210","ISSN":"0737-8831","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2012,3,2]]},"language":"en","page":"60-81","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Invisible institutional repositories: Addressing the low indexing ratios of IRs in Google Scholar","title-short":"Invisible institutional repositories","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/07378831211213210/full/html","volume":"30"},

  {"id":"simons_open_2003","abstract":"New ways of documenting and describing language via electronic media coupled with new ways of distributing the results via the World‐Wide Web offer a degree of access to language resources that is unparalleled in history. At the same time, the proliferation of approaches to using these new technologies is causing serious problems relating to resource discovery and resource creation. This paper describes the infrastructure that the Open Language Archives Community (OLAC) has built to address these problems. Its technical and usage infrastructures address problems of resource discovery by constructing a single virtual library of distributed resources. Its governance infrastructure addresses problems of resource creation by providing a mechanism through which the language‐resource community can express its consensus on recommended best practices.","author":[{"family":"Simons","given":"Gary F."},{"family":"Bird","given":"Steven"}],"container-title":"Literary and Linguistic Computing","DOI":"10.1093/llc/18.2.117","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2003]]},"language":"English","page":"117-128","title":"The Open Language Archives Community: An Infrastructure for Distributed Archiving of Language Resources","type":"article-journal","volume":"18"},
