  {"id":"booij_arabic_2018-1","abstract":"This chapter examines nonconcatenative morphology of Arabic with a particular focus on its templatic nature. While much of the past research on Arabic templatic morphology has centered on the verbal system, our discussion largely takes up the nonverbal templatic morphology of Arabic including the comparative, nouns of profession, and the diminutive. In developing formal analyses of these constructions we speciﬁcally address the question of how the prosodic templates that characterize Arabic morphology are incorporated into the schema of CxM. We also brieﬂy touch upon the implication that the construction analysis might have on two (opposing) approaches to Arabic morphology, root-based vs. word-based, given that some templatic constructions in Arabic seem to require the consonantal root as its base. The goal of this chapter, then, is not only to make known the fuller extent of Arabic templatic morphology (i.e. beyond the verbal system), but also to show advantages of approaching these prosodic issues in construction terms.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",1,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Davis","given":"Stuart"},{"family":"Tsujimura","given":"Natsuko"}],"citation-key":"booij_arabic_2018-1","collection-number":"4","collection-title":"Studies in Morphology","container-title":"The Construction of Words","DOI":"10.1007/978-3-319-74394-3_12","editor":[{"family":"Booij","given":"Geert"}],"event-place":"Cham","ISBN":"978-3-319-74393-6 978-3-319-74394-3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018"]]},"language":"en","page":"315-339","publisher":"Springer International Publishing","publisher-place":"Cham","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Arabic Nonconcatenative Morphology in Construction Morphology","type":"chapter","URL":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/978-3-319-74394-3_12"},

  {"id":"koffi_towards_2014-1","abstract":"Tone is a conundrum for linguists attempting to reduce African languages to writing. Anecdotal, empirical, and experimental data indicate that not marking tone at all leads to reading difficulties. The converse is also true, namely marking tone exhaustively reduces fluency, leads to false starts, and repairs. This article proposes an elegant but simple solution to get out of this catch twenty-two situation. First, a historical overview of various tone marking schemes is discussed. Second, the concept of Tone Optimality Model (TOM) is introduced and exemplified. The proposed model succeeds in reducing tonal density in texts without affecting readability. The main advantage of TOM over other tone marking schemes is that it draws insights from well-established phonological theories, from the Interactive Reading Model, and from research on tone universals. As a result, tone can be written minimally with maximum benefits for readers.","author":[{"family":"Koffi","given":"Ettien N"}],"citation-key":"koffi_towards_2014-1","container-title":"Linguistic Portfolios","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014"]]},"language":"en","page":"163-190","source":"Zotero","title":"Towards an Optimal Representation of Tones in the Orthographies of African Languages","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://repository.stcloudstate.edu/stcloud_ling/vol3/iss1/12","volume":"3"},
  {"id":"mcpherson_tone_2017-2","abstract":"Diversity in African Languages contains a selection of revised papers from the 46th Annual Conference on African Linguistics, held at the University of Oregon. Most chapters focus on single languages, addressing diverse aspects of their phonology, morphology, semantics, syntax, information structure, or historical development. These chapters represent nine different genera: Mande, Gur, Kwa, Edoid, Bantu, Nilotic, Gumuzic, Cushitic, and Omotic. Other chapters investigate a mix of languages and families, moving from typological issues to sociolinguistic and inter-ethnic factors that affect language and accent switching. Some chapters are primarily descriptive, while others push forward the theoretical understanding of tone, semantic problems, discourse related structures, and other linguistic systems. The papers on Bantu languages reflect something of the internal richness and continued fascination of the family for linguists, as well as maturation of research on the family. The distribution of other papers highlights the need for intensified research into all the language families of Africa, including basic documentation, in order to comprehend linguistic diversities and convergences across the continent. In this regard, the chapter on Daats’íin (Gumuzic) stands out as the first-ever published article on this hitherto unknown and endangered language found in the Ethiopian-Sudanese border lands.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",1,13]]},"author":[{"family":"McPherson","given":"Laura"}],"citation-key":"mcpherson_tone_2017-2","collection-number":"1","collection-title":"Contemporary African Linguistics","container-title":"Diversity in African languages","DOI":"10.17169/langsci.b121.282","editor":[{"family":"Payne","given":"Doris L"},{"family":"Pacchiarotti","given":"Sara"},{"family":"Bosire","given":"Mokaya"}],"event-place":"Berlin","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017"]]},"page":"5–22","publisher":"Language Science Press","publisher-place":"Berlin","source":"DOI.org (Datacite)","title":"Tone features revisited Evidence from Seenku","type":"chapter","URL":"http://langsci-press.org/catalog/book/121"},
  {"id":"oh_cross-language_2013-2","abstract":"The notion of functional load (FL) quantifies the role a phonological contrast plays in keeping words distinct in a given language. Several studies have emphasized its potential impact on language evolution and acquisition, and FL has repeatedly been mentioned as a useful tool to supplement phonological descriptions for more than seventy years. It is nevertheless still rarely explored and this paper is a contribution to filling this gap. By adopting an information-theory approach and a measure of FL proposed by Hockett (1955), we performed a corpus-based comparison of three non-tonal (English, Japanese, Korean) and two tonal languages (Cantonese and Mandarin). We calculated FLs carried by segmental (vowels and consonants) contrasts and tonal contrasts (in Cantonese and Mandarin). We also evaluated the total FL associated with the vocalic system as a whole, the consonantal system as a whole, and the tonal system (when applicable). Our results suggest that i) the distributions of FLs in a phonological system are very uneven, with only a few prominent contrasts, and ii) the existence of a tonal system does not reduce the importance of vowel and consonantal contrasts, even though tone contrasts are as important as vowel contrasts in Cantonese and Mandarin.","author":[{"family":"Oh","given":"Y.M."},{"family":"Pellegrino","given":"F."},{"family":"Coupé","given":"Christophe"},{"family":"Marsico","given":"Egidio"}],"citation-key":"oh_cross-language_2013-2","container-title":"Proceedings of the Annual Conference of the International Speech Communication Association, INTERSPEECH","container-title-short":"Proceedings of the Annual Conference of the International Speech Communication Association, INTERSPEECH","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013",1,1]]},"page":"3032-3036","source":"ResearchGate","title":"Cross-language comparison of functional load for vowels, consonants, and tones","type":"article-journal"},

  {"id":"roberts_visual_2009-1","abstract":"The effect of Crowding has long been recognised by cognitive psychologists engaged in examining the reading process. Yet it is not generally taken into account by most field linguists involved in the development of tone orthographies for emerging African languages. True, there is a general recognition that diacritic overload is unhelpful, but this has never been articulated with the help of the more precise terminology already on offer from the field of cognitive psychology. Using an experimental tone orthography developed for Kabiye (Gur, Togo) as an example, I postulate that an exhaustive representation of tone by means of accents will trigger Crowding. This is a hypothesis that has yet to be tested under clinical conditions. But the aim of this article is to call the phenomenon by its name for the first time and thereby stimulate further research. I also hope to demonstrate by means of this single example the gulf that exists between cognitive psychology and linguistics. Once we recognise that the gulf exists, we can begin to build bridges.","author":[{"family":"Roberts","given":"David"}],"citation-key":"roberts_visual_2009-1","container-title":"Written Language & Literacy","DOI":"10.1075/wll.12.1.07rob","issued":{"date-parts":[["2009"]]},"language":"English","note":"1","page":"140-155","title":"Visual Crowding and the tone orthography of African languages","title-short":"Visual Crowding and the tone orthography of African languages","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1075/wll.12.1.07rob","volume":"12"},

This is no doubt due to the relative scarcity of languages that exhibit upstep. The present study examines certain tonal phenomena in Krachi, a language with two phonologically contrastive pitch levels. I argue that the Krachi data are best analyzed as involving an upward shifting of the tonal register (upstep).
