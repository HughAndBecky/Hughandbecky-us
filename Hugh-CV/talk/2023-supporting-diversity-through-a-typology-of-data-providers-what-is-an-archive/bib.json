  {"id":"bird_towards_2021","abstract":"The Open Language Archives Community (OLAC) provides a comprehensive infrastructure that has allowed our community to index and discover language resources over the past 20 years. However, OLAC infrastructure has fallen behind as the digital libraries community has continued to evolve. New investment is required in order to move OLAC into the digital libraries mainstream. This paper reports on the first 20 years of OLAC and on an agenda leading to a more sustainable future for open language archiving.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,2,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Bird","given":"Steven"},{"family":"Simons","given":"Gary"}],"citation-key":"bird_towards_2021","container-title":"Proceedings of the International Workshop on Digital Language Archives: LangArc 2021","DOI":"10.12794/langarc1851171","editor":[{"family":"Zavalina","given":"Oksana"},{"family":"Chelliah","given":"Shobhana Lakshmi"}],"event-place":"Denton, Texas","event-title":"International Workshop on Digital Language Archives","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,10,7]]},"language":"en","page":"25-28","publisher":"University of North Texas","publisher-place":"Denton, Texas","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Towards an Agenda for Open Language Archiving","type":"paper-conference","URL":"https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc1851171/"},
  {"id":"ferreira_website_2021-1","abstract":"Over the last two decades there has been a surge in activists, linguists, anthropologists, documenters digitally recording endangered language use. These unique records often are uploaded to corporate social media sites or to privately run websites. Despite popular belief, uploading these materials to a server does not mean they are archived and preserved for future generations. In this paper we discuss the differences between professional archiving systems and content management system (CMS) based approaches to making language materials accessible. Looking at the example of the Archive of Languages and Cultures of Ethnic Groups of Thailand we discuss the benefits of a Mukurtu based community website, and how linking it to a professional archive can ensure long-term preservation of precious and unique language materials.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,9,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Ferreira","given":"Vera"},{"family":"Lukschy","given":"Leonore"},{"family":"Watyam","given":"Buachut"},{"family":"Ungsitipoonpor","given":"Siripen"},{"family":"Seyfeddinipur","given":"Mandana"}],"citation-key":"ferreira_website_2021-1","container-title":"Proceedings of the International Workshop on Digital Language Archives: LangArc 2021","DOI":"10.12794/langarc1851176","editor":[{"family":"Zavalina","given":"Oksana L."},{"family":"Chelliah","given":"Shobhana Lakshmi"}],"event-place":"Denton, Texas","event-title":"International Workshop on Digital Language Archives","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,10,7]]},"page":"1-4","publisher":"University of North Texas","publisher-place":"Denton, Texas","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"A Website Is a Website Is a Website: Why Trusted Repositories Are Needed More Than Ever","title-short":"A Website Is a Website Is a Website","type":"paper-conference","URL":"https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc1851176/"},
