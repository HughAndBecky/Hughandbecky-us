  {"id":"sserwanga_exploration_2023-1","abstract":"This exploratory study is the ﬁrst one that examined student-created metadata for physical non-text resources. We applied in-depth qualitative and quantitative content analysis to the Dublin Core (DCTERMS) metadata created by the graduate students in two sections of an introductory digital library metadata course. The analysis of bibliographic records that represent paintings identiﬁed record ﬁelds in which novice metadata creators tend to make mistakes. Examples of the most common kinds of metadata errors for each quality criterion (accuracy, completeness, and consistency) are discussed and compared with results of previous relevant research. Finding of comparative analysis for the asynchronous course section and the section with synchronous class meetings are also presented. Implications are discussed, along with future directions for research.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",3,30]]},"author":[{"family":"Zavalin","given":"Vyacheslav"},{"family":"Zavalina","given":"Oksana L."}],"citation-key":"sserwanga_exploration_2023-1","collection-number":"13972","collection-title":"Lecture Notes in Computer Science","container-title":"Information for a Better World: Normality, Virtuality, Physicality, Inclusivity","DOI":"10.1007/978-3-031-28032-0_7","editor":[{"family":"Sserwanga","given":"Isaac"},{"family":"Goulding","given":"Anne"},{"family":"Moulaison-Sandy","given":"Heather"},{"family":"Du","given":"Jia Tina"},{"family":"Soares","given":"António Lucas"},{"family":"Hessami","given":"Viviane"},{"family":"Frank","given":"Rebecca D."}],"event-place":"Cham","ISBN":"978-3-031-28031-3 978-3-031-28032-0","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023"]]},"language":"en","page":"83-90","publisher":"Springer Nature Switzerland","publisher-place":"Cham","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Exploration of Accuracy, Completeness and Consistency in Metadata for Physical Objects in Museum Collections","type":"chapter","URL":"https://link.springer.com/10.1007/978-3-031-28032-0_7"},
  {"id":"zavalina_assessing_2021-1","abstract":"The quality of metadata has a direct effect on the ability to find, identify, select, obtain, and explore information; therefore, training to create high-quality metadata is an important, yet challenging, task for LIS educators. To provide such training effectively, instructors need to develop a vision for where best to focus their efforts, informed by understanding of the common metadata quality problems in student-created records and the way in which observed patterns correlate with the content and methods of instruction. Our exploratory case study addresses this need through empirical data. The article provides an overview of the metadata-creation skill building in instructional design of an online graduate metadata course at a US university and includes results of a comparative content analysis of student-created Dublin Core metadata records in three semesters based on the criteria of accuracy, completeness, and consistency. Findings reveal that accuracy and completeness issues are prevalent and that metadata quality problems revolve mainly around representation of relations and subjects and the application of controlled vocabularies. Results also indicate student confusion regarding the purpose of several metadata elements. The article discusses the findings in relation to content and methods of instruction, considers how the observed quality issues in student-created metadata might be addressed in improving skill building through curriculum development, and proposes directions for further research.","author":[{"family":"Zavalina","given":"Oksana L."},{"family":"Burke","given":"Mary"}],"citation-key":"zavalina_assessing_2021-1","container-title":"Journal of education for library and information science","DOI":"10.3138/jelis.62-4-2020-0083","event-place":"North York","ISSN":"0748-5786","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021"]]},"language":"eng","page":"423–442","publisher":"Association for Library and Information Science Education","publisher-place":"North York","source":"alliance-primo.com","title":"Assessing Skill Building in Metadata Instruction: Quality Evaluation of Dublin Core Metadata Records Created by Graduate Students","title-short":"Assessing Skill Building in Metadata Instruction","type":"article-journal","volume":"62"}
