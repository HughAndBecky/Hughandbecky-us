		"abstract": "According to the Singapore Framework, any development of a Dublin Core Application Profile (DCAP) has to include the creation of a domain model.  DC Scholarly Works Application Profile (SWAP) was the first one explicitly using Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records (FRBR) model in creating its domain model. FRBR has recently been extended with Functional Requirements for Authority Data (FRAD) and Functional Requirement for Subject Authority Data (FRSAD) thus forming the so-called FRBR family. This paper first further develops the SWAP domain model to incorporate the FRBR family models.  Then a generalized FRBR-family-based DCAP domain model is presented to be used as the basis for specific domain application profiles.",

		"abstract": "Users of digital language archives face a number of barriers when trying to discover and reuse the materials preserved in the digital collections created by current language documentation projects. These barriers include sparse descriptive metadata throughout many collections and the prevalence of audio-video materials that are impervious to text-based search. Users could more easily evaluate, navigate, and use such a collection if it contained a guide that contextualized it, summarized its contents, and helped users identify and locate items within it. This article will discuss the importance of thorough collection descriptions and finding aids by synthesizing guidelines and best practices for archival description created for traditional archives and adapting these to the structure and makeup of today’s digital language documentation collections. To facilitate the iterative description of growing collections, the checklist of information to include is presented in three groups of descending priority.",

The significance of this vein of research is exemplified by the collection of articles published by Ken Hale and colleagues in this journal in 1992 (Hale et al. 1992). These articles present themselves as case studies of language revitalization, outlining arguments for the importance of linguistic training and assessing language vitality and diversity, all with more relevance than ever nearly three decades later. Language Revitalization and Documentation, a new section of the journal, will build upon the base of knowledge as a venue for peer-reviewed research articles in language revitalization and documentation.

Are there any lexical resources for such-and-such a language? What tool works with transcripts in this particular format? What is a good format to use for linguistic data of this type? Questions like these dominate many mailing lists, since web search engines are an unreliable way to ﬁnd language resources. This paper reports on a new digital infrastructure for discovering language resources being developed by the Open Language Archives Community (OLAC). At the core of OLAC is its metadata format, which is designed to facilitate description and discovery of all kinds of language resources, including data, tools, or advice. The paper describes OLAC metadata, its relationship to Dublin Core metadata, and its dissemination using the metadata harvesting protocol of the Open Archives Initiative.",

This work provides an active illustration of the Dublin Core Metadata Initiative (DCMI) “Singapore Framework” for Application Proﬁles, presented at the DCMI Conference in 2007, by incorporating the various elements of Application Proﬁle building as deﬁned by this framework—functional requirements, domain model, description set proﬁle, usage guidelines, and data format. These elements build on the foundations laid down by the Dublin Core Abstract Model and utilize a preexisting domain model (FRBR—Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records) in order to support the representation of complex data describing multiple entities and their relationships. The challenges of engaging community acceptance and implementation will be covered, along with other related initiatives to support the growing corpus of scholarly resource types, such as data objects, geographic data, multimedia, and images whose structure and metadata requirements introduce the need for new application proﬁles. Finally, looking to other initiatives, the article will comment on how Dublin Core relates to the broader scholarly information world, where projects like Object Re-use and Exchange are attempting to better equip repositories to exchange resources.",

Primary source objects used in this research were online versions of articles published in more than 50 academic journals in physics and engineering. Articles were encoded in well‐formed XML. While able to follow DCMI guidelines generally, it was necessary to augment DCQ semantics with local extensions in order to retain desired richness of semantics and structure. Also described is related work, including development of XML schema documents necessary to validate metadata and creation of a transforming XSL stylesheet to “dumb‐down” metadata to simple Dublin Core. As a case study, this research illustrates issues encountered when expressing real‐world DCQ metadata in RDF/XML. Significant initial investment of effort was required to develop RDF facilities and expertise. Pending more applications that exploit RDF, this investment may not be warranted in all domains.",

		"abstract": "In information organization systems, metadata is often attached to both collections and items. Collection metadata and item metadata are related: one can infer facts about items from descriptions of collections, and facts about collections from descriptions of items. This sort of reasoning, which is important to finding, understanding, and using information, is guided by specific, if usually only implicit, inference rules. This dissertation explores the general nature of these rules and develops a logic-based framework of categories for collection/item metadata rules. The resulting framework has 28 rule categories related by two logical relationships. This framework has practical applications in metadata vocabulary development, metadata-enabled search and retrieval, and metadata quality and completeness. A number of foundational questions are also discussed, including the ontological nature of collections, the logic of the collection membership relationship, the semantic and logical nature of collection/item inference rules, and difficulties in the translation of colloquial metadata records into a logic-based knowledge representation language.",

		"abstract": "This paper outlines a discourse-based approach to the study of language attitudes and ethnolinguistic vitality by analyzing 25 hour-long interviews conducted with residents of Hawai‘i who identify as Native Hawaiian. In the process of asking participants to recount and reflect on their families’ language maintenance, acquisition, and loss of Hawaiian over three generations, they expressed their language attitudes in the form of stance-taking (Du Bois, 2007). Their stances revealed the various ways that they categorized and assessed the ethnolinguistic vitality of Hawaiian in their families and communities, and what role their family members’ attitudes towards Hawaiian played in their own maintenance of the language. Given the multilingual nature of Hawai‘i, their language attitudes towards Hawaiian were also frequently conveyed through taking up stances towards English and Hawai‘i Creole, two languages which are sometimes characterized as competing with Hawaiian in terms of sociolinguistic domains. The paper argues that research methodologies for the study of language attitudes can benefit from discourse analytic approaches that treat attitudes as dynamic (Liebscher & Dailey-O'Cain, 2009) and which show how language ideologies are strongly shaped by individuals’ interactional experiences over time with their family members. The analysis examines how individuals align or disalign with sentiments expressed (via reported speech) by family members about language in interview data. By making use of coding based on appraisal theory (Martin & White, 2003), the study shows how we can achieve a holistic understanding of an individual’s language attitudes while also attending to the discursive construction of varied dispositions toward family languages. In addition, since many participants reported what might be called “partial” language competence in Hawaiian, the paper contributes to recent scholarship on “new speaker” populations who make use of complex linguistic repertoires to construct ethnolinguistic identities (O’Rourke, Pujolar & Ramallo, 2015). While primordial associations between languages and cultures are often expressed in the interview data, some participants do not always identify with their parents’ and grandparents’ varieties of Hawaiian or ways of being Native Hawaiian. Instead, these speakers maintain Hawaiian in the form of codemixing and through Neo Hawaiian (NeSmith, 2005), a more recent variety of the language that has resulted from immersion schooling and language learning in higher education.
