  {"id":"bessembinder_need_2019","abstract":"A comprehensive typology or characterization of the various types of climate services is needed to give an overview that makes (potential) users aware of which climate services are available and where to look for them. It helps identify existing gaps in terms of unserved needs of the users. Different ways of characterizing climate services are used in practice. The factors used for this characterization differ depending on the intended application of the service, the delivery mechanism and project- or user-specific needs. In this paper we discuss the advantages and challenges of using different characterization factors, such as sectors, themes, regions, purposes, time horizons, data sources, level of processing of climate data, background knowledge and type of climate services providers. Some recommendations are given on the factors to use for a common typology of climate services which are understood by a wide range of users. It may be difficult to create a single common typology that will also be understood by users with little background knowledge on climate data. Intermediaries, providing training resources and guidance at web portals on how to use and interpret climate information, can be essential to overcome this problem. Gap analysis is used to compare available and required climate services. Therefore, we advise to use the same typology for the analysis of gaps in available climate services.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,3,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Bessembinder","given":"Janette"},{"family":"Terrado","given":"Marta"},{"family":"Hewitt","given":"Chris"},{"family":"Garrett","given":"Natalie"},{"family":"Kotova","given":"Lola"},{"family":"Buonocore","given":"Mauro"},{"family":"Groenland","given":"Rob"}],"citation-key":"bessembinder_need_2019","container-title":"Climate Services","container-title-short":"Climate Services","DOI":"10.1016/j.cliser.2019.100135","ISSN":"2405-8807","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,12,1]]},"language":"en","page":"100135","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Need for a common typology of climate services","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405880719300767","volume":"16"},

  {"id":"burke_user_2022-3","abstract":"Language archives, like other scholarly digital repositories, are built with two major audiences in mind. These are depositors of language data and various potential end-users of these materials: researchers (linguistics and others), language communities, students, educators, artists, etc. Being a relatively new phenomenon, language archives have made significant strides forward in providing access to digital language data. With the purpose of identifying the needs of language archive end-users (both met and currently unmet), our interdisciplinary team of linguists and information scientists interviewed language archive managers, end-users, and depositors. This study offers a first look into the decision-making processes and end-user experiences of these groups. To support the continued development of language archives, the exploratory study reported in this article provides empirical data on language archive user needs and supports some anecdotal evidence of known issues facing language archive end-users, depositors, and managers in primarily academic contexts.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,9,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Burke","given":"Mary"},{"family":"Zavalina","given":"Oksana L."},{"family":"Chelliah","given":"Shobhana L."},{"family":"Phillips","given":"Mark E."}],"citation-key":"burke_user_2022-3","container-title":"Language Documentation & Conservation","ISSN":"ISSN 1934-5275","issued":{"date-parts":[[2022,4]]},"language":"en-US","page":"1–24","publisher":"University of Hawaii Press","source":"scholarspace.manoa.hawaii.edu","title":"User needs in language archives: Findings from interviews with language archive managers, depositors, and end-users","title-short":"User needs in language archives","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://hdl.handle.net/10125/74669","volume":"16"},

  {"id":"featherstone_archive_2006","abstract":"The archive is the place for the storage of documents and records. With the emergence of the modern state, it became the storehouse for the material from which national memories were constructed. Archives also housed the proliferation of files and case histories as populations were subjected to disciplinary power and surveillance. Behind all scholarly research stands the archive. The ultimate plausibility of a piece of research depends on the grounds, the sources, from which the account is extracted and compiled. An expanding and unstable globalizing archive presents particular problems for classifying and legitimating knowledge. Increasingly the boundaries between the archive and everyday life become blurred through digital recording and storage technologies. Not only does the volume of recordable archive material increase dramatically (e.g. the Internet), but the volume of material seen worthy of archiving increases too, as the criteria of what can, or should be, archived expands.

In the wider world, discussions about functionality must drive discussions about how quality might be determined and ensured. Because the quality-enforcing structures present in the MARC world–mature standards, common documentation, and bibliographic utilities–are lacking in the metadata world, metadata practitioners desiring to improve the quality of metadata used in their libraries must develop and proliferate their own processes of evaluation and transformation to support essential interoperability.

  {"id":"hjorland_what_2008","abstract":"Knowledge Organization (KO) is about activities such as document description, indexing and classification performed in libraries, databases, archives etc. These activities are done by librarians, archivists, subject specialists as well as by computer algorithms. KO as a field of study is concerned with the nature and quality of such knowledge organizing processes (KOP) as well as the knowledge organizing systems (KOS) used to organize documents, document representations and concepts. There exist different historical and theoretical approaches to and theories about KO, which are related to different views of knowledge, cognition, language, and social organization. Each of these approaches tends to answer the question: “What is knowledge organization?” differently. LIS professionals have often concentrated on applying new technology and standards, and may not have seen their work as involving interpretation and analysis of meaning. That is why library classification has been criticized for a lack of substantive intellectual content. Traditional human-based activities are increasingly challenged by computer-based retrieval techniques. It is appropriate to investigate the relative contributions of different approaches; the current challenges make it imperative to reconsider this understanding.

  {"id":"leonardi_digital_2010","abstract":"It sounds rather odd to say that digital artifacts -- like software -- have material properties because people generally think of materials or materiality as physical substances such as wood, steel, and stone. Yet scholars increasingly talk about the \"materiality\" of digital artifacts. What do they mean? In this paper, I explore two definitions of the adjective \"material\" -- practical instantiation and significance -- in addition to its normal connotation as matter. I argue that treating materiality as the practical instantiation of theoretical ideas (like policies that allow women to vote help make material the idea that sexes are equal) or as what is significant in the explanation of a given context (like material evidence in a courtroom trial) provides a more useful framework for understanding how digital artifacts affect the process of organizing. I contend that moving away from linking materiality to notions of physical substance or matter may help scholars of technology integrate their work more centrally with studies of discourse, routine, institutions and other phenomena that lie at the core of organization theory, specifically, and social theory more broadly.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,3,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Leonardi","given":"Paul M."}],"citation-key":"leonardi_digital_2010","container-title":"First Monday","container-title-short":"FM","DOI":"10.5210/fm.v15i6.3036","ISSN":"13960466","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[[2010,6,7]]},"source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Digital materiality?
