  {"id":"gruber-miller_latin_2022","abstract":"Studies have found a strong correlation between vocabulary knowledge and L2 reading comprehension. This preliminary study of the readability of Latin texts considers how common measures of lexical complexity (word length, word frequency, lexical sophistication, lexical density, and lexical variation) can inform instructors about what texts have the least (and most) lexical complexity. By defining several key measurements of Latin lexical complexity, we establish a provisional account of the lexical difficulty of some familiar Latin texts that are frequently taught in elementary, intermediate, and advanced levels, and propose LexR, a single, informative, integrated score that provides a sense of the comparative lexical complexity of Latin texts.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,6,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Gruber-Miller","given":"John"},{"family":"Mulligan","given":"Bret"}],"citation-key":"gruber-miller_latin_2022","container-title":"New England Classical Journal","container-title-short":"NECJ","DOI":"10.52284/NECJ.49.1.article.gruber-millerandmulligan","ISSN":"26925850, 26925869","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2022,7,15]]},"language":"en","page":"80-101","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Latin Vocabulary Knowledge and the Readability of Latin Texts: A Preliminary Study","title-short":"Latin Vocabulary Knowledge and the Readability of Latin Texts","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://crossworks.holycross.edu/necj/vol49/iss1/8/","volume":"49"},
