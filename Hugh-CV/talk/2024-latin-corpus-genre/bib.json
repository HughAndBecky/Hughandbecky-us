The paper distinguishes among various ways that linguistic features can be distributed within and across texts; it analyses the distributions of several particular features, and it discusses the implications of these distributions for corpus design.","author":[{"family":"Biber","given":"Douglas"}],"citation-key":"biber_representativeness_1993-1","container-title":"Literary and Linguistic Computing","DOI":"10.1093/llc/8.4.243","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["1993"]]},"language":"en","page":"243–257","source":"Zotero","title":"Representativeness in Corpus Design","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://otipl.philol.msu.ru/media/biber930.pdf","volume":"8"},

  {"id":"chaudhuri_small_2019","abstract":"Abstract\n            Identifying the stylistic signatures characteristic of different genres is of central importance to literary theory and criticism. In this article we report a large-scale computational analysis of Latin prose and verse using a combination of quantitative stylistics and supervised machine learning. We train a set of classifiers to differentiate prose and poetry with high accuracy (&gt;97%) based on a set of twenty-six text-based, primarily syntactic features and rank the relative importance of these features to identify a low-dimensional set still sufficient to achieve excellent classifier performance. This analysis demonstrates that Latin prose and verse can be classified effectively using just three top features. From examination of the highly ranked features, we observe that measures of the hypotactic style favored in Latin prose (i.e. subordinating constructions in complex sentences, such as relative clauses) are especially useful for classification.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",2,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Chaudhuri","given":"Pramit"},{"family":"Dasgupta","given":"Tathagata"},{"family":"Dexter","given":"Joseph P"},{"family":"Iyer","given":"Krithika"}],"citation-key":"chaudhuri_small_2019","container-title":"Digital Scholarship in the Humanities","DOI":"10.1093/llc/fqy070","ISSN":"2055-7671, 2055-768X","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",12,1]]},"language":"en","page":"716-729","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"A small set of stylometric features differentiates Latin prose and verse","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://academic.oup.com/dsh/article/34/4/716/5258951","volume":"34"},

Over 100 North American digital collections websites were examined, and the results blended with data received from communications with parties responsible for digital collections metadata.

  {"id":"egbert_designing_2022","abstract":"Corpora are ubiquitous in linguistic research, yet to date, there has been no consensus on how to conceptualize corpus representativeness and collect corpus samples. This pioneering book bridges this gap by introducing a conceptual and methodological framework for corpus design and representativeness. Written by experts in the field, it shows how corpora can be designed and built in a way that is both optimally suited to specific research agendas, and adequately representative of the types of language use in question.  It considers questions such as 'what types of texts should be included in the corpus?', and 'how many texts are required?' – highlighting that the degree of representativeness rests on the dual pillars of domain considerations and distribution considerations. The authors introduce, explain, and illustrate all aspects of this corpus representativeness framework in a step-by-step fashion, using examples and activities to help readers develop practical skills in corpus design and evaluation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",1,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Egbert","given":"Jesse"},{"family":"Biber","given":"Douglas"},{"family":"Gray","given":"Bethany"}],"citation-key":"egbert_designing_2022","DOI":"10.1017/9781316584880","event-place":"Cambridge","ISBN":"978-1-107-15138-3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022"]]},"publisher":"Cambridge University Press","publisher-place":"Cambridge","source":"Cambridge University Press","title":"Designing and Evaluating Language Corpora: A Practical Framework for Corpus Representativeness","title-short":"Designing and Evaluating Language Corpora","type":"book","URL":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/designing-and-evaluating-language-corpora/7EEB6023C0F9332869204D1EE8E5E78F"},
