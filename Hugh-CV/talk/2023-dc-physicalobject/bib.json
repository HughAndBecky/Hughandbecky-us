  {"id":"bird_extending_2003-2","abstract":"As language data and associated technologies proliferate and as the language resources community expands, it is becoming increasingly difﬁcult to locate and reuse existing resources. Are there any lexical resources for such-and-such a language? What tool works with transcripts in this particular format? What is a good format to use for linguistic data of this type? Questions like these dominate many mailing lists, since web search engines are an unreliable way to ﬁnd language resources. This paper reports on a new digital infrastructure for discovering language resources being developed by the Open Language Archives Community (OLAC). At the core of OLAC is its metadata format, which is designed to facilitate description and discovery of all kinds of language resources, including data, tools, or advice. The paper describes OLAC metadata, its relationship to Dublin Core metadata, and its dissemination using the metadata harvesting protocol of the Open Archives Initiative.","author":[{"family":"Bird","given":"Steven"},{"family":"Simons","given":"Gary F."}],"citation-key":"bird_extending_2003-2","container-title":"Computers and the Humanities","DOI":"10.1023/A:1025720518994","ISSN":"0010-4817","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2003]]},"language":"en","page":"375-388","title":"Extending Dublin Core Metadata to Support the Description and Discovery of Language Resources","type":"article-journal","volume":"37"},
  {"id":"bird_olac_2001-4","abstract":"As language data and associated technologies proliferate and as the language resources community rapidly expands, it has become difficult to locate and reuse existing resources. Are there any lexical resources for such-and-such a language? What tool can work with transcripts in this particular format? What is a good format to use for linguistic data of this type? Questions like these dominate many mailing lists, since web search engines are an unreliable way to find language resources. This paper describes a new digital infrastructure for language resource discovery, based on the Open Archives Initiative, and called OLAC -- the Open Language Archives Community. The OLAC Metadata Set and the associated controlled vocabularies facilitate consistent description and focussed searching. We report progress on the metadata set and controlled vocabularies, describing current issues and soliciting input from the language resources community.","author":[{"family":"Bird","given":"Steven"},{"family":"Simons","given":"Gary F."}],"citation-key":"bird_olac_2001-4","container-title":"Proceedings of ACL/EACL Workshop on Sharing Tools and Resources for Research and Education","editor":[{"family":"DeClerck","given":"Thierry"},{"family":"Krauwer","given":"Steven"},{"family":"Rosner","given":"Mike"}],"event-place":"Université de Toulouse, France","issued":{"date-parts":[[2001]]},"language":"English","page":"7-18","publisher":"EACL-ACL; elsnet","publisher-place":"Université de Toulouse, France","title":"The OLAC metadata set and controlled vocabularies","type":"chapter","URL":"https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/W01-1506"},

  {"id":"sserwanga_exploration_2023","abstract":"This exploratory study is the ﬁrst one that examined student-created metadata for physical non-text resources. We applied in-depth qualitative and quantitative content analysis to the Dublin Core (DCTERMS) metadata created by the graduate students in two sections of an introductory digital library metadata course. The analysis of bibliographic records that represent paintings identiﬁed record ﬁelds in which novice metadata creators tend to make mistakes. Examples of the most common kinds of metadata errors for each quality criterion (accuracy, completeness, and consistency) are discussed and compared with results of previous relevant research. Finding of comparative analysis for the asynchronous course section and the section with synchronous class meetings are also presented. Implications are discussed, along with future directions for research.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,3,30]]},"author":[{"family":"Zavalin","given":"Vyacheslav"},{"family":"Zavalina","given":"Oksana L."}],"citation-key":"sserwanga_exploration_2023","collection-number":"13972","collection-title":"Lecture Notes in Computer Science","container-title":"Information for a Better World: Normality, Virtuality, Physicality, Inclusivity","DOI":"10.1007/978-3-031-28032-0_7","editor":[{"family":"Sserwanga","given":"Isaac"},{"family":"Goulding","given":"Anne"},{"family":"Moulaison-Sandy","given":"Heather"},{"family":"Du","given":"Jia Tina"},{"family":"Soares","given":"António Lucas"},{"family":"Hessami","given":"Viviane"},{"family":"Frank","given":"Rebecca D."}],"event-place":"Cham","ISBN":"978-3-031-28031-3 978-3-031-28032-0","issued":{"date-parts":[[2023]]},"language":"en","page":"83-90","publisher":"Springer Nature Switzerland","publisher-place":"Cham","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Exploration of Accuracy, Completeness and Consistency in Metadata for Physical Objects in Museum Collections","type":"chapter","URL":"https://link.springer.com/10.1007/978-3-031-28032-0_7"}
