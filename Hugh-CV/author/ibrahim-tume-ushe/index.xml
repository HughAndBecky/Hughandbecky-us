      <description>&lt;p&gt;Becky received a grant to facilitate the collection of oral story data. The terms of the grant require her to record and archive oral histories of U̠t-Ma&amp;rsquo;in speakers. My role in this project was to work with U̠t-Ma&amp;rsquo;in speakers (who actually did the recordings themselves) and present these to the Becky in way that she could arrange the files for archiving. In my role I got to visit around 40 different places in 7 different dialects. All from the back of a motorbike.&lt;/p&gt;
