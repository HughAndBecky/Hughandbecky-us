  {"id":"kelli_challenges_2018","abstract":"The authors address the transformation of research data into open data. The article draws on the experience in four countries: Sweden, Finland, Estonia and Lithuania. The transformation process presents several challenges where legal, organizational and individual aspects influence\nthe process. Research data often contain personal data. Research data could also be covered with intellectual property (IP) rights. This means that personal data and IP regulations should be integrated into the dissemination model. While there is a potential conflict between the policies for\nopen data that aim to make data freely available and those of an entrepreneurial university that emphasize commercialization of research results, these policies need to be made compatible. Researchers producing data are vital for reconciling the two, but they currently lack the motivation\nto contribute towards the implementation of the open data policy due to missing career incentives.","author":[{"family":"Kelli","given":"Aleksei"},{"family":"Mets","given":"Tõnis"},{"family":"Vider","given":"Kadri"},{"family":"Värv","given":"Age"},{"family":"Jonsson","given":"Lars"},{"family":"Lindén","given":"Krister"},{"family":"Birštonas","given":"Ramūnas"}],"citation-key":"kelli_challenges_2018","container-title":"International Journal of Technology Management & Sustainable Development","container-title-short":"International Journal of Technology Management & Sustainable Development","DOI":"10.1386/tmsd.17.3.227_1","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018]]},"page":"227–251","source":"IngentaConnect","title":"Challenges of transformation of research data into open data: The perspective of social sciences and humanities","title-short":"Challenges of transformation of research data into open data","type":"article-journal","volume":"17"},

The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) establishes an EU-wide framework for the processing of personal data for research purposes while at the same time allowing for some flexibility on the part of the Member States.

In the first section, we present some fundamental concepts of data protection relevant to language research. In the second section, the general framework of processing personal data for research purposes is discussed.
