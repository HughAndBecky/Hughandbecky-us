      <title>Diversity and Typology Across OLAC Providers</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Are all data providers to OLAC archives as some in the literature seem to imply, or are these implications an artifact of some other framing mechanism? In linguistics, framing is the establishment of a context under which a narrative is experienced. Lakoff and Filmore are both researchers in the concepts around framing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.language-archives.org&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Open Language Archives Community (OLAC)&lt;/a&gt; metadata profile is built on 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.dublincore.org/specifications/dublin-core/dcmi-terms&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Dublin Core&lt;/a&gt; and 
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/openarchivesprotocol.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;OAI&lt;/a&gt;. Essentially OLAC OAI feeds (to the OLAC aggregator) are modified (or &amp;ldquo;enhanced&amp;rdquo; using the XML attribute &lt;code&gt;xsi:type=&amp;quot; &amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt;) OAI-PMH feeds. The OAI protocol was originally developed to be used by repository software to communicate with other repositories—in an effort to make a network of repositories. The OAI protocol works well as designed. The OLAC implementation of OAI inherits some of the OAI provided terms and concepts. When OLAC was first created, the profile was originally assumed to be describing archived language resources, and archives were assumed to be repositories—at least in the OAI sense. Many, including recent publications talk about &amp;ldquo;archives&amp;rdquo; providing records to the OLAC aggregator. These claims and references are interesting, confusing, and inaccurate—though if the sense of archive, is really and OAI repository, then I seen the connection. However, that is not what most people think of when they hear &lt;em&gt;language archive&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;archive&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The framing of terms from the OAI context is laid out in the 
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/openarchivesprotocol.html#Introduction&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;introduction to the OAI-PMH standard&lt;/a&gt;. The following definitions are given.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Data Providers&lt;/em&gt; administer systems that support the OAI-PMH as a means of exposing metadata; and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Service Providers&lt;/em&gt; use metadata harvested via the OAI-PMH as a basis for building value-added services.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A &lt;em&gt;repository&lt;/em&gt; is a network accessible server that can process the 6 OAI-PMH requests in the manner described in this document.&lt;/strong&gt; A repository is managed by a data provider to expose metadata to harvesters. To allow various repository configurations, the OAI-PMH distinguishes between three distinct entities related to the metadata made accessible by the OAI-PMH.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The distinction here is that the corporate entity implementing data sharing technology is the &lt;em&gt;Data Provider&lt;/em&gt;. While the server technology implementing the access is call the &lt;em&gt;repository&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, within the OLAC documentation and academic literature presenting OLAC further conceptualization of terms occurs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The use of the term &amp;ldquo;archive&amp;rdquo; to mean all data providers to OLAC is  &lt;em&gt;interesting&lt;/em&gt; from a linguistic point of view because by calling &lt;em&gt;Data Providers&lt;/em&gt; (in the OAI sense) &amp;ldquo;archives&amp;rdquo; authors use the language of inclusion which maps well to the concepts of &amp;ldquo;open&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;community&amp;rdquo; which can be found in the OLAC name, but the language of inclusion here does not acknowledge the diversity of the kinds of data providers. While inclusion and an under representation of diversity are the impacts, there may be other factors as well. If we look at the OLAC documentation, the documentation in the examples and in the XML elements calls things &amp;ldquo;archives&amp;rdquo;. Consider the 
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.language-archives.org/OLAC/protocol.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;OLAC Protocol&lt;/a&gt; which is an extension of the basic OAI-PMH protocol. Specifically, in 
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.language-archives.org/OLAC/protocol.html#OLAC%20archive%20description&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;section 3&lt;/a&gt; where OLAC data providers are required to return a specific element when the OAI-PMH verb &lt;code&gt;Identify&lt;/code&gt; is used. The title of the XML element is &lt;code&gt;olac-archive&lt;/code&gt;.  It has two possible attribute values &lt;code&gt;personal&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;institutional&lt;/code&gt;. The example given is as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;olac-archive
      xmlns=&amp;quot;http://www.language-archives.org/OLAC/1.0/&amp;quot;
      xmlns:xsi=&amp;quot;http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance&amp;quot;
      xsi:schemaLocation=&amp;quot;http://www.language-archives.org/OLAC/1.0/
                 http://www.language-archives.org/OLAC/1.0/olac-archive.xsd&amp;quot;
      type=&amp;quot;institutional&amp;quot;&amp;gt;
   &amp;lt;archiveURL&amp;gt;http://www.ethnologue.com&amp;lt;/archiveURL&amp;gt;
   &amp;lt;curator&amp;gt;Raymond G. Gordon, Jr.&amp;lt;/curator&amp;gt;
   &amp;lt;curatorTitle&amp;gt;Ethnologue Editor&amp;lt;/curatorTitle&amp;gt;
   &amp;lt;curatorEmail&amp;gt;mailto:editor_ethnologue@sil.org&amp;lt;/curatorEmail&amp;gt;
   &amp;lt;institution&amp;gt;SIL International&amp;lt;/institution&amp;gt;
   &amp;lt;institutionURL&amp;gt;http://www.sil.org&amp;lt;/institutionURL&amp;gt;
   &amp;lt;shortLocation&amp;gt;Dallas, USA&amp;lt;/shortLocation&amp;gt;
   &amp;lt;location&amp;gt;7500 W. Camp Wisdom Rd., Dallas, TX 75236, U.S.A.&amp;lt;/location&amp;gt;
   &amp;lt;synopsis&amp;gt;The Ethnologue data provider gives a metadata record for every
   language entry in the Web edition of the Ethnologue.  The latter provides
   basic information about each of the 7,000+ modern language of the world
   (both living and recently extinct).&amp;lt;/synopsis&amp;gt;
   &amp;lt;access&amp;gt;Every resource described by the Ethnologue data provider is a
   public Web page that may be accessed without restriction. Reuse of 
   material on the site is subject to the Terms of Use that are
   posted.&amp;lt;/access&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/olac-archive&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we see in the above example, the &lt;code&gt;olac-archive&lt;/code&gt; or OAI &lt;em&gt;repository&lt;/em&gt; is the Ethnologue. It is typed as an &lt;em&gt;institutional&lt;/em&gt; OLAC archive. However, is the Ethnologue actually a language archive? What language resource can you go to the archive and get? It seems to me to be more like a typological database about socio-linguistic topics. While it might be too late now to do anything about it, the OLAC schema could have used the XML element &lt;code&gt;olac-provider&lt;/code&gt; as a more neutral term.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The use of the term &amp;ldquo;archive&amp;rdquo; to mean all data providers to OLAC is &lt;em&gt;confusing&lt;/em&gt; because the language of academic discourse around language archives and OLAC data providers is not discrete. That is, the language does not provide distinct categories where categories would be helpful. The OLAC protocol distinguishes between organizations and personal data providers, but OLAC doesn&amp;rsquo;t make any further distinction. Research which uses OLAC records as a dataset should take the diversity of data providers into account as analyses present observations and claims—especially about the description of artifacts, or percentages of Dublin Core Element use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally the claims that all data providers are &amp;ldquo;archives&amp;rdquo; is &lt;em&gt;inaccurate&lt;/em&gt;—or careless at best. In my assessment I find that there is a mix of provider types which does not neatly fit into the &lt;code&gt;personal&lt;/code&gt; / &lt;code&gt;institutional&lt;/code&gt; dichotomy. In part that is because the &lt;code&gt;personal&lt;/code&gt; / &lt;code&gt;institutional&lt;/code&gt; dichotomy describes the &lt;em&gt;OAI Data provider&lt;/em&gt;, not the &lt;em&gt;OAI repository&lt;/em&gt;. As I evaluate the diversity of OAI repositories I find the dimension of &lt;code&gt;personal&lt;/code&gt; / &lt;code&gt;institutional&lt;/code&gt; less useful than one which included the terms: &lt;em&gt;Archive, Repository, Museum, Gallery, Library, Special Collection, Personal Portfolio, Lab or Department Portfolio, Project Portfolio, Typological Database, &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; Bibliography&lt;/em&gt;. Roughly these fall into the broad categories of &lt;em&gt;access institutions&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;exhibits&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;reference resources&lt;/em&gt;. The following diagram puts these terms on a gradient of a data provider which is highly likely to have an advertised resource and be able to provide access to that resource to a provider which is likely not able to provide access to an advertised resource. It is this second dimension which is likely to impact the nature of OLAC records more than the first dimension of &lt;code&gt;personal&lt;/code&gt; / &lt;code&gt;institutional&lt;/code&gt;. The second dimension should be considered when using OLAC records as an object of study. If OLAC were to revise its protocol, these other terms should be considered to provide a better context for evaluating the quality and completeness of the records.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Since at least 2014 I have been using 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://software.sil.org/xlingpaper&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;XLingPaper&lt;/a&gt; as a composition tool. I have collaborated with Andy Back who is the primary programmer/author of XLingPaper.  Our collaboration can be characteized as me contributing ideas, suggestions, problems, test cases, and bug reports. Following the defense of my M.A. Thesis, which I wrote using XLingPaper, Andy and I together published a paper in TugBoat which disucsses XLingPaper use of TeX technology. My contribution to the XLingPaper community is ongoing through my annotated bibliography of works produced via XLingPaper and additional contributions to the software. Someday I hope that the citation and referencing process within XLingPaper will become more robust but that is a big task.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Work-for-Hire and Open Access</title>
      <link>https://hughandbecky.us/Hugh-CV/post/work-for-hire-and-open-access/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 23 May 2021 14:35:45 +0100</pubDate>
      <guid>https://hughandbecky.us/Hugh-CV/post/work-for-hire-and-open-access/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Rights and access are a major issue in &amp;ldquo;ethical&amp;rdquo; linguistics. That is, within the European Union (but also elsewhere) there has been a major push to make research outputs Open Access. Often in this context the presupposition is that the research is being conducted as part of federal/national government organizations such as institutes or universities.  However, other organizational structures exist both within Europe and elsewhere. For instance, research may be conducted at a private corporation, by a non-profit organization, or by a private university, or by an unaffiliated individual. The push for Open Access has often been positioned within a narrative, that access to and reuse of government funded research outputs should not become encumbered by legal constraints. The ensuing argument then for linguistic research, which is often grant funded by governments is that the &amp;ldquo;ethical approach to research&amp;rdquo; is that the research outputs are costlessly accessible and unencumbered in their re-use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are several frameworks which establish rights within the EU context. However, the primary one which has been addressed in the literature and is presented as an encumberment to &amp;ldquo;research&amp;rdquo; is the &lt;em&gt;copyright framework&lt;/em&gt;. To address encumberments by the copyright framework and other ethical considerations, the 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201618&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;FAIR guidelines were developed&lt;/a&gt;. FAIR addresses the copyright consideraction through the suggestion of using creative commons licenses. This essentially releases copyright liability which is  automatically applied via the copyright framework. This is usually done through a Creative Commons license, applied by the work&amp;rsquo;s creator. However, two major issues with this strategy seem to not be addressed by the larger publishing (and equally applicable to all research outputs) and distribution networks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Addressing the 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work_for_hire&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Work-for-Hire doctrine&lt;/a&gt; where the research was conducted as part of the work a researcher was hired to do for an organization. That is, an author (researcher at a university) does not have the right to apply a creative commons license to their authored works, rather, it is their employer who holds this right. What is vastly under-expressed in the academic creative commons licensed literature is how the rights of the employing organizations are being curtailed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second issue with some creative commons licensed works is the use of the &amp;ldquo;non-commercial&amp;rdquo; clause. This clause has no discrete definition. As such it is not clear how it should or &lt;em&gt;should not&lt;/em&gt; be applied. But applied especially in the context of academic business activities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This set of references tracts some of the issues which are raised under the first point above. The application of the employer–employee contract in the context of academic institutions.&lt;/p&gt;

There are some bibliometrics and scientometric studies focused on linguistics which look a specific journals, certain time depths across several journals

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
.  These journals may be currently active or may have ceased their publishing, or changed the name of the journal (increasing the number of serials counted).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Defining the discipline is hard. For example, should one include the fields of Language Documentation, Anthropology, or Philology? Therefore the exact scope seems fuzzy but if we go with the 1700 number presented by the MIAR project it gives us a start. I have read several studies which focus on 10-year segment of a journal&amp;rsquo;s history (not linguistics) and they generally report that in a 10-year time span about 450 articles are produced.
One approach would be to multiply 450 by 1700 and estimate the number of articles from there (765,000 articles). But this leaves us without knowing how many active journals there are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have noticed that career linguists in the academy publish about three articles a year (more-or-less). Christopher Phipps, on his blog

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
 postulates that in 2010 there were about 5379 linguists. More-or-less this might give us a growth rate of about 16,000 articles per year. I recall reading somewhere that a major commercial linguistic bibliography added between 9,000 and 11,000 articles between its annual versions. Since we don&amp;rsquo;t anticipate complete coverage of by the team behind the bibliography it seems that the 16,000 number is closer to reasonable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we assume that the 16,000 number has been constant and covers the 765,000 total articles this gives us between 47 and 48 years of publishing history. Obviously the 765,000 number would be smaller than the total number of relevant language research publications (say since the 1500&amp;rsquo;s). But presumably the rate of publication growth is accelerating with innovations in publishing technology, the growth of the global population, and the growth of the academic and industrial application of language knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still another way of estimating how many articles are produced a year are to look at the rate of DOI usage or the growth of specific databases of articles. Not all journals or publishers use DOIs, and databases are also limited to those journals they index so it is not a fool-proof method but it would give us an approximate rate and a comparable rate with other disciplines. This method was attempted by

      <title>Bibliography of select papers on &#39;ethics&#39; and &#39;informed consent&#39; in Linguistic research</title>
      <link>https://hughandbecky.us/Hugh-CV/post/informed-consent-irb-biblography/</link>

      <guid>https://hughandbecky.us/Hugh-CV/post/informed-consent-irb-biblography/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is a short non-exhaustive bibliography of papers which discuss &lt;em&gt;Informed consent&lt;/em&gt; in the context of one or more of the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;minority language communities,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;low literacy levels,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;language research,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the legal aspect of the US IRB, and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;lsquo;how informed is informed consent&amp;rsquo; .&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have several nagging questions, which I wonder how discussed they are including: &amp;ldquo;Is Intellectual property rights of minority language people covered in the typical informed consent protocols of language researchers?&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;How ethical is it to create voice-to-speech tools for a small language community when only one or two people provide voice samples?&amp;rdquo; When working independently, outside the confines of an organization these factors are not mitigated by institutional barriers to creativity or participant considerations.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Legal Frameworks in Language Research</title>

      <pubDate>Sat, 10 Feb 2018 14:14:38 -0700</pubDate>
      <guid>https://hughandbecky.us/Hugh-CV/post/legal-frameworks-in-language-research/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the process of doing research for the paper &amp;ldquo;Copyright and the distributed Lexicon. I started to realize that one very useful tool would be to have a refernece for copyright terms and scope related to a national framework where an indegious community might be located.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally there are other legal issues to consider when doing language research work. These also need to be researchable and associated with languages for those looking to do language research work. This project seeks to make such resources more easily discoverable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following links are a good starting point:&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This project includes combining and collating several U̠t-Ma&amp;rsquo;in databases that Becky Paterson has created over the 12 years she has worked with the U̠t-Ma&amp;rsquo;in language community. We are also importing as many Hausa terms as possible for specific elicitation (such as regional plants and animals). The final database includes grammatical features of individual lexemes. We are including various external analyses from phonology tools. None of this data is currently public. But when it is, a link from here will be posted.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Language Survey</title>
      <link>https://hughandbecky.us/Hugh-CV/post/language-survey/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 27 Aug 2016 18:20:45 +0100</pubDate>
      <guid>https://hughandbecky.us/Hugh-CV/post/language-survey/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;SIL International has a survey service which operates across the globe in different administrative SIL units. I wonder, if the future of survey is no-longer looking at where indigenous people are living and what language variations they may have, but rather looking at where these people are going. Consider just the migrants from Nigeria according to 
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lucify.com/the-flow-towards-europe&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;lucify.com&lt;/a&gt; 89,032 Nigerians have immigrated towards Europe in the last 4 years. That is a lot of people. Language Survey has had a business function to generate information about ethnolinguistic communities in preperation for various kinds of language development activites. Other busiensses have customer serveys and market surveys. Language Survey serves a similar function. Perhaps the following questions ought to be asked:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Where do those people come from?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What languages do they speak?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What linguistic load is being put on European governmental services?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What could SIL offer to these governmental agencies?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How could various social organizations benefit from SIL&amp;rsquo;s often long standing work in the regions that these immigrants are coming from?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;89,000 sounds a lot but it’s a pretty small percentage of the population of Nigeria. Maybe we need to continue to look at where most speakers of a language live but also look at where people are relocating both within and outside their country of origin. Census data doesn’t usually do a good job of tracking languages of migrants beyond the major languages, but there may well be other tools to supplement the data.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Linguistic Service Policies</title>
      <link>https://hughandbecky.us/Hugh-CV/post/linguistic-service-policies/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 06 Mar 2015 14:35:45 +0100</pubDate>
      <guid>https://hughandbecky.us/Hugh-CV/post/linguistic-service-policies/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Working in services design and web-data handeling, I see a lot of different policies and data handling practices. However should there some special set of practices related to language data? I am exploring this question in a github repository. More specifically, services are an increasing component of today&amp;rsquo;s 21st century economy. Data services are more common and important to social function than ever before. This has impacts on academics doing research in linguistics and also impacts minority language users and communities of users who care about &amp;ldquo;their data&amp;rdquo;. This should challenge potential service providers to consider the following questions: What should Linguistic Services Policies look like? and What kinds of things should they cover? Founders of new services focusing on linguistics, language, and cultural heritage oriented data interactions and transactions may be aware of data concerns from a legal framework (within a certain country) point of view, but, they may be unfamiliar with data concerns as viewed by the community. While the concerns of minority language using communities may not be well known to businesses familiar with data handling procedures, these practices are often known to linguists working in and with communities of minority language users. An additional layer of complexity is that in many cases service users in minority language communities, may not understand the possible data protection rights available to them, or why they may need additional rights in digital contexts.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The OWL and the Rice Farmer</title>
      <link>https://hughandbecky.us/Hugh-CV/post/the-owl-and-the-rice-farmer/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 04 Jun 2014 14:14:38 -0700</pubDate>
      <guid>https://hughandbecky.us/Hugh-CV/post/the-owl-and-the-rice-farmer/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In a recent email I was asked by a &lt;em&gt;European Linguistic Professional SIL Colleague&lt;/em&gt; about the ease of use of 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://archive.mpi.nl/tla/elan&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;ELAN&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is ELAN easy enough to use, so that an Indonesian rice farmer can use it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am offended with the &amp;lsquo;rice farmer&amp;rsquo; terminology which is prevalent in SIL discourse. However, to understand this term, and its usage I think it is important to understand another term used prior to &lt;em&gt;the rice farmer&lt;/em&gt; — &lt;em&gt;The Ordinary Working Linguist&lt;/em&gt;. This older phrase has gained some traction as evidenced by its adoption in the linguistic literature&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;,&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;,&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;,&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;,&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:5&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:5&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;,&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:6&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:6&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;,&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:7&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:7&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;,&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:8&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:8&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The OWL&lt;/em&gt; or &amp;lsquo;ordinary working linguist&amp;rsquo; is attributed 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.icsi.berkeley.edu/icsi/blog/chuck-fillmore-dies-at-84&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;by George Lakoff&lt;/a&gt; to Charles Fillmore as a self-describing term. Though it is impossible to say if Fillmore actually coined the term. If he did, then it is an interesting frame by the discoverer of cognitive framing. I have yet to meet an &lt;em&gt;ordinary linguist&lt;/em&gt;. I have met smart linguists, extraordinary linguists, novel linguists, quirky linguists, geeky linguists, and ornery linguists — but never an &lt;em&gt;ordinary one&lt;/em&gt;. The second issue I take with this contrived frame is that it suggests that somewhere there might be a &lt;em&gt;non-working linguist&lt;/em&gt;. Now, either I have never met a lazy linguist, or I have been foiled by some collective endeavor. That is, the linguists I have met have somehow &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; decided that I am an extremely boring person — the kind to be avoided, and &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; have feigned busyness! Granted busyness is not the same as &amp;ldquo;working&amp;rdquo;, but I have never met a linguist who is not engaged in some sort of activity which has a mistakable similitude to &lt;em&gt;work&lt;/em&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the same, the notion of &amp;ldquo;OWL&amp;rdquo; seems to be very useful to a large group of linguists. For instance, 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://scholars.sil.org/gary_f_simons/preprint/computing_environment&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Gary F. Simons suggests&lt;/a&gt; that Helen Aristar Dry proposed a book in the early 1990s with the title &lt;em&gt;Computers and the Ordinary Working Linguist.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:9&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:9&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, While David Nathan, Peter Austin, Andrew Black, Piotr Bański, Mike Cahill, Jeff Good, Steven Moran, Scott Farrar, and René van den Berg all use the term in their works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In honor of Fillmore, if we take a framing view of the phrase &amp;ldquo;ordinary working linguist&amp;rdquo; we can see that many of the authors are discussing the concept within the frame of linguistic computing — the computer tools that linguists use to do their work. However, it can be argued that there is an SIL specific shift in the framing of the phrase (usage by Cahill, Schroeder, Simons, Black, and van den Berg). Van den Berg&amp;rsquo;s use is most articulate:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the typical SIL fieldworker is what has been called an ‘owl’, that is, an ‘ordinary working linguist’ who has been given enough training to enable him or her to do the job; this  is usually a minimum of  two semesters of field linguistics at graduate level. A typical SIL field worker is therefore very  much a generalist, without specialist knowledge in any branch of linguistics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Van den Berg&amp;rsquo;s usage is both confirmed and then contrasted by 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20130308204655/https://www.sil.org/linguistics/people&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;SIL International&lt;/a&gt; on its website where it contrasts the term with &lt;em&gt;Linguistics Coordinators&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Linguistics Consultants&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;International Linguistics Advisors&lt;/em&gt;. It is clear to see that within the shared frame by SIL staff, that Linguistic Consultants are those who have more training than typical SIL field workers. For several reasons, including reduced staffing, and paradigm shifts within project management related moral ownership within the tasks of language development, SIL has moved from ex-pat driven projects to nationally staffed and ethnolinguistic community driven projects. SIL&amp;rsquo;s minimally trained &amp;ldquo;OWLs&amp;rdquo; moved up the organizational chart to become project managers/facilitators, leaving open the &amp;ldquo;bottom&amp;rdquo; of the chart, ergo the new need for &amp;lsquo;rice farmer&amp;rsquo; as a newly perceived class of computer user.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I find the term &lt;em&gt;rice farmer&lt;/em&gt; 14 times in the internal SIL International wiki and I find &amp;ldquo;OWL&amp;rdquo; 83 times. These terms surface mostly among SIL computer app developers, but I also hear them used by SIL policy and procedures developers, SIL program planners, and SIL educators. To me this term comes off as a class distinction term (and maybe there is nothing wrong with class distinction; I mean the Jews had class distinctions at the time of Jesus, the Cretans had classes at the time of Titus, the British have it, and castes are alive and well in India, etc.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:10&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:10&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;). However, as I find the term being used in SIL, a more transparent term might be &amp;lsquo;low socio-economic and low educational &lt;em&gt;capacity&lt;/em&gt; individual&amp;rsquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem is that in my work with Steve Marlett in Mexico, I worked with ethnolinguistic moronity language users who were not &amp;lsquo;low educational capacity individuals&amp;rsquo; rather they were high educational capacity individuals. When I went to Malaysia and worked with Sean Conklin, the same thing, ethnolinguistic minority language users were not low educational capacity individuals. When I went to Nigeria and worked with people like Becky Paterson and David Rowbory, the people doing language work with us were not low educational capacity individuals. In fact the Nigerian rice farmer/pastor/student/translator/cultural guide/language activist who was on our language project team can and does use ELAN after some training (and uses Facebook without training to boot — FYI: I need training on ELAN too!). So, why then do SIL staff use terms like &amp;lsquo;rice farmers&amp;rsquo; when they talk about designing software for users? Something seems to be wrong with this picture. My guess is that there is a real reason why SIL staff use the term, but it is not the reason that SIL staff attribute as the causation of the observation of &amp;ldquo;low educational capacity individuals&amp;rdquo; - as we observe dark skinned colleagues who try and use SIL software and don&amp;rsquo;t intuitively know how to use the tools. My guess is that the reason for the use of the term is because it is part of the SIL corporate ethos. SIL staff use (or at least have in the past) their educational courses at various SIL training events as filters to find the &amp;lsquo;best and brightest students&amp;rsquo; and recommend those for various field service within SIL. Then in the advanced classes SIL staff obfuscate the materials just to make them harder, to see if those same students are able to still keep up. So, as I see it, there seems to be this undefined class difference in SIL&amp;rsquo;s corporate sociology preferring those who can distill obfuscated communications under stress and dis-preferring those who cannot distill obfuscated signals under stress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So for the following four reasons I strongly dis-prefer the terms &amp;lsquo;rice farmer&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;OWL&amp;rsquo; as they often appear in SIL discourse:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t think the &amp;lsquo;rice farmer&amp;rsquo; terminology is actually very useful for professional reasons. Software design is about communicating. It is about communicating relational concepts in a visual context. It is about connecting new analogies with salient concepts. User Interface (UI - what a software user sees and interacts with) is the gateway to User Experience (UX - the emotional, logical, task based context of activities that are attempting to be facilitated by the software designer and accomplished by the software user). Therefore what UX is really about is communicating ideas and creating positive and successful interactions. If the UI fails to create the designed UX then it doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter if the user is a rice farmer or a Ph.D. candidate from an Australian university. The end result is that the user is frustrated and will not use the software willingly. Therefore, singling out the &amp;lsquo;rice farmer&amp;rsquo; from the white guy is not really a useful construct because all users, whether black, white, tan, farmer, or stockbroker, are subject to the same constraints and frustrations of software which is not intuitively implemented. It is my experience that programmers (not just SIL programmers) usually do not intuitively know how application users think or behave. UX design is an art and a science that takes experimentation and a solid grasp of information design principles.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s not forget that, at least in software design we are talking about the &amp;lsquo;rice farmer&amp;rsquo; with a computer, an iPad, or an android device.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We never use the American Corn Farmer, or the Norwegian Reindeer Rancher as analogies, and I am a bit tired of singling out people from tropical areas because their skin is darker, or their average height is shorter, or because they grow rice in their backyard. The focus on the &amp;lsquo;rice farmer&amp;rsquo; does not help us deal with the white guy&amp;rsquo;s problem with the software and robs us of a balanced view of the real communication challenge.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using the term &amp;lsquo;rice farmer&amp;rsquo; seems to put the ethnolinguistic minority language users and nationals in a sub-standard class relative to &amp;lsquo;real linguists&amp;rsquo; or &amp;lsquo;real missionaries&amp;rsquo;. Yes, my African colleagues who do have their own farms and families, also use SIL software; I first drove a tractor at age 13 and grew up on a farm, so what is the difference? By making the &amp;lsquo;OWL&amp;rsquo; or the &amp;lsquo;rice farmer&amp;rsquo; as some uninitiated or limited capacity person,  the &amp;ldquo;reason&amp;rdquo; for new design (i.e the reason that 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://software.sil.org/wesay&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;WeSay&lt;/a&gt; was created to work with 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://software.sil.org/fieldworks&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;FLEx&lt;/a&gt;) doesn&amp;rsquo;t solve the fact that even for highly-educated-white-professionals FLEx is still confusing. The issue is a visual communications issue not a smarts or intelligence issue. Linguistic concepts can be communicated about beautifully and communicated simply, both in the classroom and in software. &lt;!-- also note the framing that John Hatton has taken about PhD in having training for software but nations don&#39;t in his presentation  on SayMore here: https://scholarspace.manoa.hawaii.edu/handle/10125/26153?mode=full --&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope this post motivates those in SIL to take a deeper look at User Experience issues in the software tools and websites we build.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Open Educational Resources OER Links</title>
      <link>https://hughandbecky.us/Hugh-CV/post/open-educational-resources-links/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2013 14:35:45 +0100</pubDate>
      <guid>https://hughandbecky.us/Hugh-CV/post/open-educational-resources-links/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A few weeks a go I put together a resource (&amp;ldquo;whitepaper&amp;rdquo;) outlining an economic strategy related to 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_educational_resources&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Open Educational Resources (OER)&lt;/a&gt; and mobile compatible resources. The purpose was to kickstart and provide ideas for the organization I work for to consider alternative models of information maintenance and dissemination. The following links are more or less my list of references which did not make into that paper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Economically (in terms of information economy), the problem I see with 
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.corestandards.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;CommonCore&lt;/a&gt; as it is implemented in the USA across grades 1-12, is that law and policy affect the kinds of resources being produced and subsequently also shared in these curriculum development co-op endeavors (OER). I think the impact is greater than originally anticipated (or perhaps not, perhaps this is a foreign policy move affecting exports of knowledge). The indirect impact of CommonCore on the consumers of these OER materials, is that when people from other countries consume Open Education Resources, they are consuming CommonCore. Thankfully, there is a lot of OER work going on at the university level and outside of the scope of CommonCore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also to note: OER works well with some subjects in which there is very little change; like science (chemistry and physics) or math. There is so much ground to cover in these subjects that OER makes sense. However, for subjects like linguistics, where models are proposed all the time, and subsequently challenged, it is harder to produce an OER resource with a lot of buy-in among educators.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Audio Dominant Texts and Text Dominant Audio</title>
      <link>https://hughandbecky.us/Hugh-CV/post/audio-dominant-texts-and-text-dominant-audio/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 18 Mar 2013 14:35:45 +0100</pubDate>
      <guid>https://hughandbecky.us/Hugh-CV/post/audio-dominant-texts-and-text-dominant-audio/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;As linguistics and language documentation interface with digital humanities there has been a lot of effort to time-align texts and audio/video materials. At one level this is rather trivial to do and has the backing of comercial media processes like subtitles in movies. However, at another level this task is often done in XML for every project (digital corpus curation) slightly differently. At the macro-scale the argument is that if the annotation of the audio is in XML and someone wants to do something else with it, then they can just convert the XML to whatever schema they desire. This is true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, one antidotal point that I have not heard in discussion of time aligned texts is specifications for Audio Dominant Text vs. Text Dominant Audio. This may not initially seem very important, so let me explain what I mean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;audio-dominant-text&#34;&gt;Audio Dominant Text&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are those texts which were first captured orally. They are a performance. The content may be prepared (in the sense of the telling of a traditional epic), but they are not read texts. They are given from memory. The text lives. In terms of time aligned transcription, from this performance is transcribed. This oral text type stands in contrast to the &lt;em&gt;Text Dominant Audio&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;text-dominant-audio&#34;&gt;Text Dominant Audio&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Text dominant audio is where a text is read, scripted or prompted. Several examples of this exist, a radio drama, a cartoon/animated film, a reading. In linguistics a wordlist would also classify. The guiding principle is &lt;em&gt;What is guiding the audio?&lt;/em&gt; Is it the structure of the text based document or is it the image of the oral segment as it comes to the speaker spontaneously without visual or interactive reliance?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This difference should be noted in metadata durring oral text collection durring language documentation projects. In one project I was involved in, several speakers were recored who were reading texts which they had composed, written and typed. Some editorial help was provided by the PI on some of the texts. These texts now exist as both oral and written texts (in terms of modality). But is the written form a transcription? I doubt it. It is like the inverse of a transcription. The oral but these texts can be presented online similarly to Nick Thieberger’s presentation of text through EOPAS. Example: &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.eopas.org/transcripts/65&#34;&gt;http://www.eopas.org/transcripts/65&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess in terms of XML, my outstanding question is: &lt;em&gt;How should the structure be represented?&lt;/em&gt; If the reading is only a reading, then should the text be head in the XML document and the audio matched to that? Obviously some would say that even readings are performances and I do agree to an extent. However, even with these performances because the non-spontaneous nature of the delivery, and the previous editing of the text, is there a smoothing out of the text which might be equivalent to removing dialectical syntactic variation?&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Grants being aggregated in OLAC Search results</title>
      <link>https://hughandbecky.us/Hugh-CV/post/olac-grant-aggregator/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 18 May 2012 23:45:45 +0100</pubDate>
      <guid>https://hughandbecky.us/Hugh-CV/post/olac-grant-aggregator/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have been doing some thinking about what would make 
&lt;a href=&#34;http://search.language-archives.org&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;OLAC search&lt;/a&gt; more valuable to its current users and to its targeted users. One of the things which would make it more useful would be if the NSF, a partial funder for 
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.language-archives.org&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;OLAC&lt;/a&gt; and OLAC search, would aggregate its language related grants, scholarships, fellowships and awards through OLAC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of these Grant proposals are really well written, and well cited documents which explain a certain snapshot of the language situation. Even the announcements that a grants like 
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward.do?AwardNumber=0966411&amp;amp;WT.z_pims_id=12816&#34; title=&#34;Douglas Whalen Grant&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;From Endangered Language Documentation to Phonetic Documentation&lt;/a&gt; has been awarded would allow other researchers to know that someone has applied or been awarded a block of funding to work on a particular language situation.&lt;/p&gt;

But aggregating this knowledge with prior research would really give interested parties in particular languages the integrated perspective of how funding has impacted the development and research of minority languages.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>SEO Considerations for Linguistic Resources</title>
      <link>https://hughandbecky.us/Hugh-CV/post/seo-considerations-for-linguistic-resources/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 19 Feb 2012 14:35:45 +0100</pubDate>
      <guid>https://hughandbecky.us/Hugh-CV/post/seo-considerations-for-linguistic-resources/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;SEO for standard websites is pretty straight forward. I happen to be working on a website redesign (in Drupal) which presents Linguistic resources both published and unpublished. I recently came across two specialized SEO options which are useful:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Integration with Google Scholar&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Aggregation with 
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.language-archives.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;OLAC&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;google-scholar&#34;&gt;Google Scholar&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google Scholar’s page on getting data into Google Scholar: &lt;a href=&#34;http://scholar.google.com/intl/en/scholar/inclusion.html&#34;&gt;http://scholar.google.com/intl/en/scholar/inclusion.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;http://drupal.org/project/biblio&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Biblo&lt;/a&gt;, a module for drupal which handles bibliographic data had something 
&lt;a href=&#34;http://drupal.org/node/641580&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This blog also has an interesting write up: &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.reallywow.com/archives/123&#34;&gt;http://blog.reallywow.com/archives/123&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;olac-search&#34;&gt;OLAC Search&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This means implementing the 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.openarchives.org/pmh/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;OAI-PMH protocol&lt;/a&gt; so that OLAC can harvest it.
I am not sure how this is done exactly… but here is the link: &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.language-archives.org/&#34;&gt;http://www.language-archives.org/&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Headphones for Language Documentation</title>
      <link>https://hughandbecky.us/Hugh-CV/post/headphones-for-language-documentation/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 11 Apr 2011 14:35:45 +0100</pubDate>
      <guid>https://hughandbecky.us/Hugh-CV/post/headphones-for-language-documentation/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Looking at the overall audio recording picture in Language Documentation, the place of headphones is not to be taken lightly. The total recording act has a performer, performing the speech act, a microphone recording the sounds, a recording device digitizing the input from the microphone. And while it could all stop there, an additional step is needed – the monitoring of the input to the recording device. High quality sound is important in the recording process. If the Documenter does not have and ear for what a recording should be (training), then they are not going to be able to tell the difference between a good recording, a mediocre recording and a bad recording. It think it is well known, if not commonly acknowledged that a good mic is needed to make quality recordings (recordings which are faithful at recording the input). Likewise it is no less true that to listen to that recording to assure that it is truly a faithful recording a speaker or set of headphones is needed to produce a faithful output of the recording. So high quality audio (faithfulness to input and to the recording) is not only needed in the capture phase of the recording event but also in the monitoring phase (and the playback phase) of the recording event. Here inter the importance of headphones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is possible to record with out monitoring the recording but, actively monitoring recorded audio allows for on-the-spot quality control. I have seen some tears shed when a documenter waited till later to find out that the mic record level was set too low or that the record button was not pushed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is also possible to record with low quality headphones, or headphones which are not faithful to the recording. But when these kinds of speakers or headphones are used there is no way to accurately access the quality of the recording. I have seen a good quality recording played through laptop speakers and questioned as being a “quality” recording. I have also seen a poor quality recording listened to on poor quality speakers and thought it was a fine recording, only to find out later what the true quality of the recording really was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recording volume (or Mic sensitivity) + Speaker volume = Total listening experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just raising the volume on a speaker or a pair of headphones might make the audio more hearable but does not mean that a good recording is being captured. Conversely, a low speaker volume and a high mic record level does not make a great recording either. (It might be the right setup for your recording session but it does not guarantee a good recording all the time.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
 headphones are about &lt;em&gt;Monitoring the Recording&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;headphones-vs-speakers&#34;&gt;Headphones v.s. Speakers&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Headphones have the distinct advantage over Speakers for not re-introducing noise into a recording, especially in a field recording environment. However, both can be used to monitor a recording. When I recorded in a professional recording studio the mixing room was isolated from the performance rooms and we had Speakers in the mixing room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;different-uses&#34;&gt;Different Uses&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Different kinds of Headphones serve different purposes. A good knowledge of your purpose and a good knowledge of the right kinds of headphones will lead to a great experience. First, lets take a look at the audio listening needs on a language documentation project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Documenter&lt;/em&gt; listening to the audio feed while video taping.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Documenter&lt;/em&gt; listening to the audio while recording.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Documenter&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Consultant&lt;/em&gt; listening to audio while recording with the BOLD method.

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Documenter&lt;/em&gt; editing audio and video.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Documenter&lt;/em&gt; doing analysis and annotation in the field with tools like 
&lt;a href=&#34;http://audacity.sourceforge.net&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Audacity&lt;/a&gt;, 
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.fon.hum.uva.nl/praat&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Praat&lt;/a&gt; and

&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Documenter&lt;/em&gt; listening to their iPod in their hammock at night.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With these difference in mind, it is easy to see that various Language Documentation Projects will have different functional requirements depending on the project goals. Additionally, Language Documentation projects often have constraints on their weight of gear to area of service ratios. (Sometimes the documenter just can’t take everything. So take the right tool for the job and hope that tool is light weight.) Headphones come into the equation, as apposed to speakers, because they can deliver high quality sound at a low weight. However, should the language documenter just grab their iPod headphones and think that they will be alright?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-kinds-of-headphones-are-there&#34;&gt;What kinds of headphones are there?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are several basic kinds of headphones which can be roughly broken down into 4 types of headphones (Depending on who is consulted.) Types of headphones on:&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;


&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;First, there are over-the-ear headphones or &lt;em&gt;Circumaural&lt;/em&gt; headphones which cover the wearers ears completely.
These come in two varieties: 
	&lt;ol&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Open Back - which lets ambient noise into the wearer&#39;s ear canal.&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Closed Back - which isolates the wearer from noise which is not in the recording.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Second, there are on-the-ear headphones or &lt;em&gt;Supra-aural&lt;/em&gt; headphones. Supra-aural headphones sit on the wearers ear rather than covering it completely.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Lastly, there are in-the-ear headphones. This group can actually be divided into two sub-groups:
	&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ear buds, such as the Apple iPod Earphones, which sit in the wearers outer ear, just above the opening of the ear canal.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;True in-the-ear headphones or &lt;em&gt;In-ear monitors&lt;/em&gt; which are actually inserted into your ear canal and isolate the wearer from exterior noise.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;how-do-i-know-a-good-set-of-headphones-from-a-bad-set&#34;&gt;How do I know a good set of headphones from a bad set?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well there are several ways we can answer the question as to what is &amp;ldquo;good&amp;rdquo; set of head phones. The most succinct way to say it is likely to be:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Closed back circumaural, 20-20k.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
— Will Reiman
&lt;p&gt;More generally, consider weight, size, durability, fit, frequency response and price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Weight:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Lower the weight the better: less strain on the neck after hours of use and the less weight to carry around with you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Size:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do they fold up? Are they compact and easy to pack and carry with your other gear?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fit:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Are they comfortable for people with large ears?&lt;/em&gt; You might not have large ears but if you are asking someone else to wear them then will it be comfortable for them, especially if you are asking them to wear them for a long period of time (long recording sessions).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Can they be worn with an over the head mic?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Can they be worn by someone wearing glasses?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Are they adjustable?&lt;/em&gt; Adjustable for head circumference and pronation around the ear.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quality of sound:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Frequency response&lt;/em&gt;: Frequency response should minimally be 20Hz-20kHz. (because that is generally the range of human hearing.) I like going for 5Hz-30kHz because it gives me a full range of bass. I feel like I am hearing the whole range of sound.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Flat response&lt;/em&gt;: Just like microphones, speakers (and headphones) can make some frequencies (warmer) try and get a set of head phones which are true to signal (flat response).&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Price:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think I paid $50 (USD) for the Sony MDR-V600 even though the suggested manufactures price is over $100. So look look around. Find a deal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Comments: These came in a packaged kit with the &lt;a href=&#34;www.zoom.co.jp/english/products/h4n/&#34;&gt;Zoom H4n&lt;/a&gt;. They are a bit on the heavy side. they do have a nice sound to them. The do have an adjustment slider to fit various sizes of heads. They are not very compact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How I use them: I use these to actively monitor recorded audio.

&lt;p&gt;Summary: A High frequency response range and a good reputation for durability. The Sony MDR-V600 is not to be confused with the Sony MDR-V6 which only has a response rate of 10Hz - 20,000Hz. (Many search engines do confuse the two.)

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Geo-linguistics is a methodology of plotting various linguistic dimensions on cartographic displays. When I started in language documentation there were not many resources for interdisciplinary cartographers. Maps are very useful, but potentially deceptive tools. I wrote a 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://hugh.thejourneyler.org/2012/types-of-linguistic-maps-the-mapping-of-linguistic-features/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; in 2012 titled: “Types of Linguistic Maps: The Mapping of Linguistic Features and Researcher Interactivity.” At one time ranked within the top three hits (via Google) for linguistic maps and ranks first for &amp;ldquo;types of linguistic maps&amp;rdquo;. As a result it was cited several times in academic literature. (It&amp;rsquo;s interesting to see how various people respond to my post. For some it has been very influential—almost copying it—and other using it for fodder.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No less than four academic articles cite it. I have been encouraged by one of the authors to take the article to print. Maybe one day I will. It seems that the tyranny of the urgent dictates my writing schedule. Articles which cite my post can be found at the following links:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The focus of my blog post was just the start of the acquisition of more skills in the area of cartography. I address more areas, including linguistics and ways of plotting languages in 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://hugh.thejourneyler.org/category/cartography/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;my series of posts on cartography&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Interdental approximant</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This research project was spearheaded by Ken Olson. As a collaborator with him I focused on the historical linguistics status of the interdental approximant in Philippine languages. I also did a lot of library resources discovery and acquisition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Follow-up work&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems that the interdental approximant [ð̞] in Austronesian languages should challenge linguists in three important areas and thus deserves more thought and perhaps application in our theories. These categories are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The phonological status and interactions that happen with the segment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The phonetic contrast of the segment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Historical status of the segment and the impact of its recognition in the Austronesian historical linguistic narrative.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Publications to date have focused on two relevant aspects of the interdental approximant:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ð̞ is important in descriptive linguistics.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ð̞ is different phonetically from other described segments.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following remain to be shown clearly in appropriate publications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Phonetic contrast&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is the duration of the sound and what are the boarders?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Measure the stable section?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Where does it stop and where does it begin?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is the acoustical (in terms of both production and perception) difference between /l/ and /ð̞ /?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ulturasound study does provide a good starting point to answer these questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ð̞ it has a unique spectrograph when compared with other liquids, vowels, and interdentals - especially within the same language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ð̞ is different from the native sounds of { l, a, ɐ, n, ʔ, d, g, r, s, h, x} which occur in Philippine languages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This has been done in small phonology descriptions but not full scale acoustically reference-able phonetic descriptions across the entire set of languages discussed in the &lt;em&gt;JIPA&lt;/em&gt; article.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ð̞ is different from the borrowed sounds of { l, a, ɐ, n, ʔ, d, g, θ, ð, r, s, h, x, ɣ}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In terms of psycholinguistics the question remains,: &lt;em&gt;What are the unique properties of this sound as they are culturally defined?&lt;/em&gt; or to put this another way: &lt;em&gt;What are the acustic cues, what are the visual cues, and what are the cultural constraints that those cues may violate?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My research position suggests that there has been change. Change involves a variety of cognitive processes. Re-analysis is one such process. If I hypothesize that re-analysis has occurred, then what is the Cognitive load of this segment? How has that load shifted or why can it shift?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What are the unique properties that users attribute to this segment as cross-linguistically defined (but keeping within Austronesian or the Austro-Tai hypotheses).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What are those unique properties as Universally or empirically defined?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Historical Narrative&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is an open question with relationship to historical Austronesian as to what the metrical structure of the language was. If we posit some change in the metical structrue what relevance does that have on the interdental approximant? Does the concept of Phonetic Gemination apply?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In some theories of 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austro-Tai_languages&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Austro-Tai&lt;/a&gt; there is some relevance to constructing suprasegmental features and genisis or de-genesis processes for these features. In that contexts: &lt;em&gt;Is it possible that ð̞ is a tone bearing unit? (TBU)&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interdental is contrastive with dental in Place in the IPA Chart
ð̞ is important to PAn Historical Phonology Theory&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ð̞ is related to several mergers and splits&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ð̞ is PAn *R&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ð̞ Shows that [+Nasal], historically, is, or is/and a super-segmental feature in Austronesian languages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ð̞ shows that there are fewer proto-phonemes than necessary in current models
of PAn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ð̞ helps us to understand the PAn foot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ð̞ was represented in the baybin original orthography.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ð̞ is relevant enough to be represented consistently in orthographies in the
languages it occurs in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Phonology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are several open phonological questions. Some of these have answers in the cited materials, but the data is not always clear for all languages which also have interdental approximants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What are the claimed Phonemes of kangayen?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would be all the more the claim that ð̞ is phonemic not due to a split. If it is a retention then this perspective has more weight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is the ð̞ pattern concerning natural classes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a feature geometry perspective, what features does ð̞ have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some Austornesian language have Metathesis. Is this metathesis process triggered in any way by the ð̞?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ð̞ has moraic value - what is it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is the affect of ð̞ on vowel quality?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In what ways can we measure the impact that ð̞ has on cognitive load?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does the ð̞ occur in multiple areas of the lexicon&lt;/p&gt;
