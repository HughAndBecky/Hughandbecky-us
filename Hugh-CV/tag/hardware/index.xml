      <description>&lt;p&gt;From time to time I get asked what set up I recommend for linguists&amp;rsquo; to use when they are making field recordings. The requests often go like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greetings, I&amp;rsquo;m writing because I am just about to head out to do field work for my degree and I&amp;rsquo;m wondering if you have any advice on the latest audio recorders for linguistic fieldwork.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My response is invariably to pivot and respond to the question by asking what sort of products they would like to make. That is, linguists need to think about what can be done with the recordings, and how they need to influence the audio product&amp;rsquo;s creation and future use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Making good audio recordings is about making recordings someone will want to listen to again, and again, and again. Invariably researchers (linguists) will listen to their recordings over and over again as they transcribe them. However their recordings gain value when others also want to listen to them. I recently was listening to a presentation where the presenter from Brazil, demonstrated some audio recordings from his field work. He showed a picture of the recording set up. In the picture it showed that he was using a Zoom H4n. In the recordings it was evident that the gain on the mics was pumped really high. The picture showed that he was using the built in mics. In the recording, the background noise was really full front while the speaker was perceptually distant — the chicken and the noise floor (the sound of &amp;ldquo;air&amp;rdquo; in the recording) were louder than the language speaker. Controlling for these factors are fundamental issues in basic crafting of audio recordings. Craftsmen (and women) who appreciate their art will get the tools they need to make their art (and artifacts) usable and enjoyable. This presenter from Brazil, played a recording from a language in which there are only about 8 speakers left&amp;hellip; linguistically the language is already like a classic car with low mileage—RARE. However, a good recording of a rare language is like a classic car dipped in gold. Microphone choice and placement allows the audio craftsman to tune down the gain, get closer to the subject and thereby record at levels where the signal to noise ratio (the sound of &amp;ldquo;air&amp;rdquo;) and the chickens are not heard in the recording or are perceptively in the far background rather than in the foreground&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. The ability to attenuate a listener to specific parts of the audio stream is where the artistry and the skill comes into full view. It is this applied artistry that makes audio recordings valued and worth listing to over and over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In contrast to audio craftsmen, linguists are generally not interested in good sounding audio, they are only interested in completing their dissertation or the next published article which proves their theoretical hypothesis or generates points with their tenure and promotion board. Audio artifacts (recordings) are not primary products of interest to a linguist, rather it is what is done with them that is of their concern. This whole approach to language recording militants against good audio recordings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One linguist with whom I collaborated, when asked how they wanted to manage the recordings (both the technical aspect of production, and the file system organization of the recordings) was not concerned with either. That person was (at the time) ambivalent because their advisor was advising the PhD dissertation not some fieldwork project. That linguist&amp;rsquo;s goal wasn&amp;rsquo;t to produce a body of work (recordings) which could be used beyond the dissertation, the goal was to do enough fieldwork to complete the dissertation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the advisor&amp;rsquo;s perspective, as long as the fieldwork produced some written data to present in the dissertation the core requirements were satisfied. I followed the career of that linguist and now they are in a post-doc at a reputable organization. The post-doc was advertised pre-COVID and included funding for fieldwork. However, due to COVID this linguist has relied on their prior field recordings in (presumably) unexpected ways. The organization and quality of the recordings impacts their productivity as they now need to reference those recordings. Within the context of the current post-doc and the global climate, job performance productivity is not evaluated as being above average or below average. However, the career building blocks for the next post-doc or position is impacted, by how the fieldwork situation and production process was managed, and the quality of the product produced. I notice that career scholars produce about four publications a year in addition to the grants that they write and win. This is a very different interactive context than negotiating interpersonal relationships on a funded project (in a lab or in a village).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a audio craftsman, I use an an 
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.microphonemadness.com/products/mmdpsm.htm&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;MMaudio DPSM-SIL mic&lt;/a&gt; or one of two 
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.rode.com/microphones/m3&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Røde M3 mics&lt;/a&gt; with a Zoom H4n digital audio recorder.  The MMaudio mic is a special set up of the mmdpsm mic with longer cords (7 feet). To order it one must call the company because they don&amp;rsquo;t put the part on-line. I think there are a few other tweaks with the DPSM-SIL and the regularly advertised DPSM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do not use Phantom power with the DPSM-SIL there is a setting through the menu of the Zoom H4n that says &amp;ldquo;plug-in power&amp;rdquo;. Turn this on.  Also be careful of plugging in the mic into things like computers. I do not know what specific computer&amp;rsquo;s mic jack setting are but they might over power the mic and damage it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are technical reasons related to mic sensitivity and faithfulness to the input which lead me to choose these two mics in 2008. However, for me the ability to plan how audio should sound and the ability to create &amp;ldquo;three dimensional texture&amp;rdquo; within the audio recording is more important than a specific microphone&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a craftsman I also suggest the use of headphones because live recordings need active monitoring. Hearing the recording is import to the production production process — what is on the recording is not what is heard in the recording environment. See my write up on headphones I have used here: &lt;a href=&#34;https://hugh.thejourneyler.org/2011/headphones-for-language-documentation&#34;&gt;https://hugh.thejourneyler.org/2011/headphones-for-language-documentation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section class=&#34;footnotes&#34; role=&#34;doc-endnotes&#34;&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:1&#34; role=&#34;doc-endnote&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found a different audio recording in a language archive which demonstrates the &amp;ldquo;air&amp;rdquo; and high-pitch noise induced into the recording. Presumably the high frequency pitch comes from the computer fan which is running nearby while recording. However, given the date of recording it might be the noise of the tape deck. The archive record does not make clear the original medium of recordings. From a sound engineer&amp;rsquo;s point of view, this is not great recording because the noise to signal ratio is really out of proportion. The recording is by Laurent Fontaine. Created in 2005. Titled: Histoire de Kanumá. &lt;a href=&#34;https://doi.org/10.24397/pangloss-0000495&#34;&gt;https://doi.org/10.24397/pangloss-0000495&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:2&#34; role=&#34;doc-endnote&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also inevitiably get asked about USB mics and mics which plug into mobile phones or tablets. I find that these tools are not worth the money or the added risks they bring to workflow managment. There are some cool features and I have used plugin devices with iOS for recording as backups. The major issue with USB plugin mics is fan noise from the computer. People often look at podcasters and say &amp;ldquo;but they are using USB mics&amp;rdquo;. To which I say, &amp;ldquo;are you making a podcast, from the far bedroom in your home in the USA? What kind of post processing do you plan on doing?&amp;rdquo; I found a really well written article which discusses these issues: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.lowdownpublishing.com/post/musicians-guide-for-video-conferencing&#34;&gt;https://www.lowdownpublishing.com/post/musicians-guide-for-video-conferencing&lt;/a&gt; . &lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

      <title>Headphones for Language Documentation</title>
      <link>https://hughandbecky.us/Hugh-CV/post/headphones-for-language-documentation/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 11 Apr 2011 14:35:45 +0100</pubDate>
      <guid>https://hughandbecky.us/Hugh-CV/post/headphones-for-language-documentation/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Looking at the overall audio recording picture in Language Documentation, the place of headphones is not to be taken lightly. The total recording act has a performer, performing the speech act, a microphone recording the sounds, a recording device digitizing the input from the microphone. And while it could all stop there, an additional step is needed – the monitoring of the input to the recording device. High quality sound is important in the recording process. If the Documenter does not have and ear for what a recording should be (training), then they are not going to be able to tell the difference between a good recording, a mediocre recording and a bad recording. It think it is well known, if not commonly acknowledged that a good mic is needed to make quality recordings (recordings which are faithful at recording the input). Likewise it is no less true that to listen to that recording to assure that it is truly a faithful recording a speaker or set of headphones is needed to produce a faithful output of the recording. So high quality audio (faithfulness to input and to the recording) is not only needed in the capture phase of the recording event but also in the monitoring phase (and the playback phase) of the recording event. Here inter the importance of headphones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is possible to record with out monitoring the recording but, actively monitoring recorded audio allows for on-the-spot quality control. I have seen some tears shed when a documenter waited till later to find out that the mic record level was set too low or that the record button was not pushed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is also possible to record with low quality headphones, or headphones which are not faithful to the recording. But when these kinds of speakers or headphones are used there is no way to accurately access the quality of the recording. I have seen a good quality recording played through laptop speakers and questioned as being a “quality” recording. I have also seen a poor quality recording listened to on poor quality speakers and thought it was a fine recording, only to find out later what the true quality of the recording really was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recording volume (or Mic sensitivity) + Speaker volume = Total listening experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just raising the volume on a speaker or a pair of headphones might make the audio more hearable but does not mean that a good recording is being captured. Conversely, a low speaker volume and a high mic record level does not make a great recording either. (It might be the right setup for your recording session but it does not guarantee a good recording all the time.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
 headphones are about &lt;em&gt;Monitoring the Recording&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;headphones-vs-speakers&#34;&gt;Headphones v.s. Speakers&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Headphones have the distinct advantage over Speakers for not re-introducing noise into a recording, especially in a field recording environment. However, both can be used to monitor a recording. When I recorded in a professional recording studio the mixing room was isolated from the performance rooms and we had Speakers in the mixing room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;different-uses&#34;&gt;Different Uses&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Different kinds of Headphones serve different purposes. A good knowledge of your purpose and a good knowledge of the right kinds of headphones will lead to a great experience. First, lets take a look at the audio listening needs on a language documentation project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Documenter&lt;/em&gt; listening to the audio feed while video taping.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Documenter&lt;/em&gt; listening to the audio while recording.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Documenter&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Consultant&lt;/em&gt; listening to audio while recording with the BOLD method.

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Documenter&lt;/em&gt; editing audio and video.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Documenter&lt;/em&gt; doing analysis and annotation in the field with tools like 
&lt;a href=&#34;http://audacity.sourceforge.net&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Audacity&lt;/a&gt;, 
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.fon.hum.uva.nl/praat&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Praat&lt;/a&gt; and

&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Documenter&lt;/em&gt; listening to their iPod in their hammock at night.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With these difference in mind, it is easy to see that various Language Documentation Projects will have different functional requirements depending on the project goals. Additionally, Language Documentation projects often have constraints on their weight of gear to area of service ratios. (Sometimes the documenter just can’t take everything. So take the right tool for the job and hope that tool is light weight.) Headphones come into the equation, as apposed to speakers, because they can deliver high quality sound at a low weight. However, should the language documenter just grab their iPod headphones and think that they will be alright?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-kinds-of-headphones-are-there&#34;&gt;What kinds of headphones are there?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are several basic kinds of headphones which can be roughly broken down into 4 types of headphones (Depending on who is consulted.) Types of headphones on:&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;First, there are over-the-ear headphones or &lt;em&gt;Circumaural&lt;/em&gt; headphones which cover the wearers ears completely.
These come in two varieties: 
	&lt;ol&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Open Back - which lets ambient noise into the wearer&#39;s ear canal.&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Closed Back - which isolates the wearer from noise which is not in the recording.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Second, there are on-the-ear headphones or &lt;em&gt;Supra-aural&lt;/em&gt; headphones. Supra-aural headphones sit on the wearers ear rather than covering it completely.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Lastly, there are in-the-ear headphones. This group can actually be divided into two sub-groups:
	&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ear buds, such as the Apple iPod Earphones, which sit in the wearers outer ear, just above the opening of the ear canal.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;True in-the-ear headphones or &lt;em&gt;In-ear monitors&lt;/em&gt; which are actually inserted into your ear canal and isolate the wearer from exterior noise.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;how-do-i-know-a-good-set-of-headphones-from-a-bad-set&#34;&gt;How do I know a good set of headphones from a bad set?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well there are several ways we can answer the question as to what is &amp;ldquo;good&amp;rdquo; set of head phones. The most succinct way to say it is likely to be:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Closed back circumaural, 20-20k.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
— Will Reiman
&lt;p&gt;More generally, consider weight, size, durability, fit, frequency response and price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Weight:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Lower the weight the better: less strain on the neck after hours of use and the less weight to carry around with you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Size:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do they fold up? Are they compact and easy to pack and carry with your other gear?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fit:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Are they comfortable for people with large ears?&lt;/em&gt; You might not have large ears but if you are asking someone else to wear them then will it be comfortable for them, especially if you are asking them to wear them for a long period of time (long recording sessions).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Can they be worn with an over the head mic?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Can they be worn by someone wearing glasses?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Are they adjustable?&lt;/em&gt; Adjustable for head circumference and pronation around the ear.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quality of sound:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Frequency response&lt;/em&gt;: Frequency response should minimally be 20Hz-20kHz. (because that is generally the range of human hearing.) I like going for 5Hz-30kHz because it gives me a full range of bass. I feel like I am hearing the whole range of sound.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Flat response&lt;/em&gt;: Just like microphones, speakers (and headphones) can make some frequencies (warmer) try and get a set of head phones which are true to signal (flat response).&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Price:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think I paid $50 (USD) for the Sony MDR-V600 even though the suggested manufactures price is over $100. So look look around. Find a deal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;sony-mdr-v600&#34;&gt;Sony MDR-V600&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My rating: 5.0 stars out of five. &lt;i class=&#34;fa fa-star&#34; aria-hidden=&#34;true&#34;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i class=&#34;fa fa-star&#34; aria-hidden=&#34;true&#34;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i class=&#34;fa fa-star&#34; aria-hidden=&#34;true&#34;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i class=&#34;fa fa-star&#34; aria-hidden=&#34;true&#34;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i class=&#34;fa fa-star&#34; aria-hidden=&#34;true&#34;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Summary: A High frequency response range and a good reputation for durability. The Sony MDR-V600 is not to be confused with the Sony MDR-V6 which only has a response rate of 10Hz - 20,000Hz. (Many search engines do confuse the two.)

      &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Headphone Type: Closed Back&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fit Style: Circumaural&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frequency Response : 5Hz - 30,000Hz&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sensitivity : 106dB/mW&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Impedance : 45 ohms&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plug Type: 1/8-inch to 1/4-inch adapter&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cable Type: curly&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cord Length: Approximately 2 meters&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Driver Unit : 40mm&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Weight: 0.5 pounds&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Comments: Between these and the Samson CH700 I like these much better. They are lighter, and more compact. They have a larger frequency response than the CH700. And they are adjustable for various head shapes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How I use them: I use these to actively monitor recorded audio. Mostly when using a &lt;a href=&#34;www.zoom.co.jp/english/products/h4n/&#34;&gt;Zoom H4n&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
