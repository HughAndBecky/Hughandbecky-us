      <title>Website License vs. Content License</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When considering internet publishing attribution and proper licensing is very important. One important context to make clear is the distinction between the HTML and visual presentation/content layer of a website, the code of a website, and any downloadable objects in a website such as PDFs. Today I was looking at the &lt;em&gt;Rapid Words&lt;/em&gt; website. &lt;em&gt;Rapid Words&lt;/em&gt; is an SIL product and methodology which facilitates a multi-party conversation to quickly discover many words in a language. SIL developed a specific website to promote this methodology and its associated downloadable content. As I review the website, I am wondering several things about the licenses advertised on the RapidWords site. The web-page I am looking at: &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.rapidwords.net/resources/files/rwc-questionnaire&#34;&gt;http://www.rapidwords.net/resources/files/rwc-questionnaire&lt;/a&gt; Screen shots are presented here for ease of access (and permanence).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;


&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the footer, I see a copyright statement and then a CC-BY-SA license. Many websites who choose to put copyright and license material in the footer are really only referencing the Theme files of their web-page, or the immediately on-screen content. This is very common for open-source themes for WordPress, Drupal, and Joomla. It is unclear to me if this is the case on the RapidWords website. Or is the footer referring to the entire content of the website inclusive of the downloadable content? If it is referring to the theme files, then they ought to be licensed as code not as a creative work according to the Creative Commons Foundation. (The Creative Commons Foundation recommends not using Creative Commons Licenses for code base projects and points to other more appropriate licenses.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I go the content of the web-page link above (see screens shot), there is a CC license field in the middel of the page. This field is empty and in lieu of a license, I find a copyright statement saying all &amp;ldquo;rights are reserved&amp;rdquo;. So which is it? CC-BY-SA or All rights reserved?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;a data-fancybox=&#34;&#34; href=&#34;https://hughandbecky.us/Hugh-CV/Hugh-CV/post/website-license-vs-content-license/decalkfgkndojdgc_huf9c93931f5b10e522981e6221644a41f_12481_2000x2000_fit_lanczos_2.png&#34; data-caption=&#34;Close-up of screen content&#34;&gt;


  &lt;img data-src=&#34;https://hughandbecky.us/Hugh-CV/Hugh-CV/post/website-license-vs-content-license/decalkfgkndojdgc_huf9c93931f5b10e522981e6221644a41f_12481_2000x2000_fit_lanczos_2.png&#34; class=&#34;lazyload&#34; alt=&#34;Close-up of screen content&#34; width=&#34;518&#34; height=&#34;211&#34;&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;


  
  
  &lt;figcaption&gt;

&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;


&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then when I download the PDF of the content via the PDF button provided the content of the PDF only contains the copyright statement not the CC-BY-SA statement. Further adding confusion because the website is offering a PDF to me but then saying that the PDF is &amp;ldquo;all rights reserved&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, when one downloads the resources under the resource section the resources do not have a license statement in them (I would have expected a copyright and a license statement in the footer of each printable page in the downloaded document).
Because there is a footer on the web-page with a CC license, is the website user to assume that these download able resources are CC-BY-SA?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Organizations can avoid sending mixed messages to their constituency by clearly marking who is the copyright holder, on websites &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; the content those websites contain. Organizational policies related to web-publishing should include editorial checks for these sorts of issues.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Which license and why?</title>
      <link>https://hughandbecky.us/Hugh-CV/post/and-why-that-license/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Part of organizational growth is the ability to project consistency while still retaining felxibility. However, in cases of institutional learning, especially where staff are cyclical, the context of organizational choices must be made clear for memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the years SIL International has published many pieces of software. Often under liberal licenses. In the case of fonts, no suitable license existed and so SIL developed the &lt;em&gt;Open Font License&lt;/em&gt;, which went on to become an de facto standard within the font producing community. In reflection, it occurs to me that every time a new license is produced it is done as a response to a social context. That is, society has delivered a certain set of norms or reactions to existing ownership and licensing practices. It also occurs to me that with each new license created that there is an increased availability of licensing options to potential license users. I was recently reading over SIL International&amp;rsquo;s LSDev&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;literature&amp;rdquo; or summary on why they are licensing their products a certain way (LSDev is a different sub-organizational group than the one which developed the &lt;em&gt;Open Font License&lt;/em&gt;). I repeatedly found the phrase (or something like it): &amp;ldquo;This was the best license to meet SIL&amp;rsquo;s goals&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; the bone I have to pick is that as a social group or organization, SIL&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;goals&amp;rdquo; are going to change and have changed. Rather than point to vague referencing terminology (which face being interpreted differently over time, even though the words might not change), these goals should be outlined in such documents. This is the same kind of linking to business reasons that are required (but often missing) for UX documentation. Often times our documentation includes what was done, but not why we did it. When writing documentation we out to strive to include enough of the context to make it clear for organizational learning as well as to determine at some future time if the social context and/or goals of our business has changed enough to warrant a reassessment of our past actions.&lt;/p&gt;
