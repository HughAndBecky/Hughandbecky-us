      <title>Dating Photos and passing on Knowledge</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have been reading &lt;a href=&#34;http://scanyourentirelife.com/2013/how-to-date-photos-family-photo-collections-sort-organize/&#34; title=&#34;Dating Photos&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;the blog &amp;ldquo;Scan Your Entire Life&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt;, and its links about scanning family photos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think one relevant point that it brings out for professional contexts, such as in archives, is: &amp;ldquo;Additionally, it [the way of naming the files] will now be documented for whomever inherits all of your work, that you didn’t know this information.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Especially with photos, which have a high metadata field to file-count ratio, representing a high curation workload. A metadata schema needs to help archivists administratively determine known unknowns rather than just empty elements.  It is one thing to choose not to describe something, it is another to not have access to the information and be unable to describe something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the links I was also reading:&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Audio Digitization</title>
      <link>https://hughandbecky.us/Hugh-CV/project/2010-americas-area-audio-digitization/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 24 Feb 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://hughandbecky.us/Hugh-CV/project/2010-americas-area-audio-digitization/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This project involved the accession, cataloging and digitization of several collections. It also involved cataloging of multiple collections already accessioned but not yet cataloged. I was responsible for identifying and collecting metadata relevant for audio collections. I communicated with the SIL Language and Culture Archive staff when metadata schemas in place were insufficient for audio collections. I identified and recommended changes to metadata profiles used at the time by the Language and Culture Archives. I consulted industry best practices and established quality control procedures related to the digitization of cassette tapes and reel to reel tapes. I served as project manager, with a volunteer workforce.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I served as project manager, recruiting and supervising a volunteer workforce. Together we cataloged and scanned over 1000 photos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also repatriated some photos. We took old photo albums to reunions where former SIL staff identified persons and places in the images.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Text Digitization</title>
      <link>https://hughandbecky.us/Hugh-CV/project/2010-americas-area-text-digitization/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 24 Feb 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://hughandbecky.us/Hugh-CV/project/2010-americas-area-text-digitization/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I worked with the SIL Americas Area Access Coordinator to make language materials available to translators, researchers, and language development workers. There is a wealth of information that is simply inaccessible to those who could use it. I helped in the implementation of a system to make these materials available digitally, via the internet. Access to these materials affects the mechanics of language development and translation projects throughout the Americas Area and around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I contributed in general to archiving processes related to text scanning, and the post processing of these scans into archival and distribution formats. I served as site manager and recruiter with a volunteer work force. I brokered accessions of older materials from their creators.
I worked with IT staff to produce an automated reporting mechanism to track team progress.&lt;/p&gt;
