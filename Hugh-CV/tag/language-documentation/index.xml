      <description>&lt;p&gt;From time to time I get asked what set up I recommend for linguists&amp;rsquo; to use when they are making field recordings. The requests often go like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greetings, I&amp;rsquo;m writing because I am just about to head out to do field work for my degree and I&amp;rsquo;m wondering if you have any advice on the latest audio recorders for linguistic fieldwork.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My response is invariably to pivot and respond to the question by asking what sort of products they would like to make. That is, linguists need to think about what can be done with the recordings, and how they need to influence the audio product&amp;rsquo;s creation and future use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Making good audio recordings is about making recordings someone will want to listen to again, and again, and again. Invariably researchers (linguists) will listen to their recordings over and over again as they transcribe them. However their recordings gain value when others also want to listen to them. I recently was listening to a presentation where the presenter from Brazil, demonstrated some audio recordings from his field work. He showed a picture of the recording set up. In the picture it showed that he was using a Zoom H4n. In the recordings it was evident that the gain on the mics was pumped really high. The picture showed that he was using the built in mics. In the recording, the background noise was really full front while the speaker was perceptually distant — the chicken and the noise floor (the sound of &amp;ldquo;air&amp;rdquo; in the recording) were louder than the language speaker. Controlling for these factors are fundamental issues in basic crafting of audio recordings. Craftsmen (and women) who appreciate their art will get the tools they need to make their art (and artifacts) usable and enjoyable. This presenter from Brazil, played a recording from a language in which there are only about 8 speakers left&amp;hellip; linguistically the language is already like a classic car with low mileage—RARE. However, a good recording of a rare language is like a classic car dipped in gold. Microphone choice and placement allows the audio craftsman to tune down the gain, get closer to the subject and thereby record at levels where the signal to noise ratio (the sound of &amp;ldquo;air&amp;rdquo;) and the chickens are not heard in the recording or are perceptively in the far background rather than in the foreground&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. The ability to attenuate a listener to specific parts of the audio stream is where the artistry and the skill comes into full view. It is this applied artistry that makes audio recordings valued and worth listing to over and over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In contrast to audio craftsmen, linguists are generally not interested in good sounding audio, they are only interested in completing their dissertation or the next published article which proves their theoretical hypothesis or generates points with their tenure and promotion board. Audio artifacts (recordings) are not primary products of interest to a linguist, rather it is what is done with them that is of their concern. This whole approach to language recording militants against good audio recordings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One linguist with whom I collaborated, when asked how they wanted to manage the recordings (both the technical aspect of production, and the file system organization of the recordings) was not concerned with either. That person was (at the time) ambivalent because their advisor was advising the PhD dissertation not some fieldwork project. That linguist&amp;rsquo;s goal wasn&amp;rsquo;t to produce a body of work (recordings) which could be used beyond the dissertation, the goal was to do enough fieldwork to complete the dissertation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the advisor&amp;rsquo;s perspective, as long as the fieldwork produced some written data to present in the dissertation the core requirements were satisfied. I followed the career of that linguist and now they are in a post-doc at a reputable organization. The post-doc was advertised pre-COVID and included funding for fieldwork. However, due to COVID this linguist has relied on their prior field recordings in (presumably) unexpected ways. The organization and quality of the recordings impacts their productivity as they now need to reference those recordings. Within the context of the current post-doc and the global climate, job performance productivity is not evaluated as being above average or below average. However, the career building blocks for the next post-doc or position is impacted, by how the fieldwork situation and production process was managed, and the quality of the product produced. I notice that career scholars produce about four publications a year in addition to the grants that they write and win. This is a very different interactive context than negotiating interpersonal relationships on a funded project (in a lab or in a village).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a audio craftsman, I use an an 
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.microphonemadness.com/products/mmdpsm.htm&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;MMaudio DPSM-SIL mic&lt;/a&gt; or one of two 
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.rode.com/microphones/m3&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Røde M3 mics&lt;/a&gt; with a Zoom H4n digital audio recorder.  The MMaudio mic is a special set up of the mmdpsm mic with longer cords (7 feet). To order it one must call the company because they don&amp;rsquo;t put the part on-line. I think there are a few other tweaks with the DPSM-SIL and the regularly advertised DPSM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do not use Phantom power with the DPSM-SIL there is a setting through the menu of the Zoom H4n that says &amp;ldquo;plug-in power&amp;rdquo;. Turn this on.  Also be careful of plugging in the mic into things like computers. I do not know what specific computer&amp;rsquo;s mic jack setting are but they might over power the mic and damage it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are technical reasons related to mic sensitivity and faithfulness to the input which lead me to choose these two mics in 2008. However, for me the ability to plan how audio should sound and the ability to create &amp;ldquo;three dimensional texture&amp;rdquo; within the audio recording is more important than a specific microphone&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a craftsman I also suggest the use of headphones because live recordings need active monitoring. Hearing the recording is import to the production production process — what is on the recording is not what is heard in the recording environment. See my write up on headphones I have used here: &lt;a href=&#34;https://hugh.thejourneyler.org/2011/headphones-for-language-documentation&#34;&gt;https://hugh.thejourneyler.org/2011/headphones-for-language-documentation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section class=&#34;footnotes&#34; role=&#34;doc-endnotes&#34;&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:1&#34; role=&#34;doc-endnote&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found a different audio recording in a language archive which demonstrates the &amp;ldquo;air&amp;rdquo; and high-pitch noise induced into the recording. Presumably the high frequency pitch comes from the computer fan which is running nearby while recording. However, given the date of recording it might be the noise of the tape deck. The archive record does not make clear the original medium of recordings. From a sound engineer&amp;rsquo;s point of view, this is not great recording because the noise to signal ratio is really out of proportion. The recording is by Laurent Fontaine. Created in 2005. Titled: Histoire de Kanumá. &lt;a href=&#34;https://doi.org/10.24397/pangloss-0000495&#34;&gt;https://doi.org/10.24397/pangloss-0000495&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:2&#34; role=&#34;doc-endnote&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also inevitiably get asked about USB mics and mics which plug into mobile phones or tablets. I find that these tools are not worth the money or the added risks they bring to workflow managment. There are some cool features and I have used plugin devices with iOS for recording as backups. The major issue with USB plugin mics is fan noise from the computer. People often look at podcasters and say &amp;ldquo;but they are using USB mics&amp;rdquo;. To which I say, &amp;ldquo;are you making a podcast, from the far bedroom in your home in the USA? What kind of post processing do you plan on doing?&amp;rdquo; I found a really well written article which discusses these issues: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.lowdownpublishing.com/post/musicians-guide-for-video-conferencing&#34;&gt;https://www.lowdownpublishing.com/post/musicians-guide-for-video-conferencing&lt;/a&gt; . &lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Becky received a grant to facilitate the collection of oral story data. The terms of the grant require her to record and archive oral histories of U̠t-Ma&amp;rsquo;in speakers. My role in this project was to work with U̠t-Ma&amp;rsquo;in speakers (who actually did the recordings themselves) and present these to the Becky in way that she could arrange the files for archiving. In my role I got to visit around 40 different places in 7 different dialects. All from the back of a motorbike.&lt;/p&gt;

I had the duty of removing the snake. While I recommend treating all snakes in Africa as venomous I had no idea if this one was or was not. I treated it like I do most snakes. Look for a makeshift snake hook (snake stick) and pin the snake for safe handling and treat it as if it were venomous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The snake was about 7 inches long and about as thick as my pink y finger 3/4 – 1 cm. It had a white striped coloring going from side to side but was mostly black/gray. The fangs were fairly widely set and its head was not triangular like a viper.

&lt;p&gt;I took pictures but it is hard to be camera man and snake handler at the same time. After catching it, I then threw the snake over the compound wall into a field. I showed the pictures around and asked what kind of snake it was, and most people said, &amp;ldquo;cobra&amp;rdquo;. While I want to believe them it is easy to imagine that &amp;ldquo;cobra&amp;rdquo; is a generalizable term (choosing an iconic snake, because who hasn&amp;rsquo;t hear of a King Cobra?) for &amp;ldquo;dangerous&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;venomous&amp;rdquo;. My perception is that most people in Nigeria believe that all snakes are deadly (along with other interesting beliefs about snakes

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
. Within this part of Nigeria there is a black necked cobra (&lt;em&gt;Naja nigricollis&lt;/em&gt;) which is a spitting cobra&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. The markings mostly did not match that description so I further discounted the cobra claims. And some suggested that the banded nature on the snake I found was due to it being juvenile and that it would grow to become a cobra.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have tried to identify the species but have not had any success. Field guides for West Africa (when they exist) are mostly without detailed pictures for each species. I have yet to find a Nigeria specific field guide for any area of biology or zoology. On hand we had several guides which were either from the 1960s or were reprints

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
, which although not about Nigeria &lt;em&gt;per se&lt;/em&gt; does contain some species which do overlap with Cameroon. However, this book offered no satisfying confirmations.&lt;/p&gt;

 A return to the Cobra hypothesis.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2021 I returned to the cobra hypothesis. I noticed that there is a Zebra snake, a spitting cobra in Namibia (which 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naja_nigricincta&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;wikipedia suggests&lt;/a&gt; has been considered to be a sub-species of the black necked cobra). While I was in Nigeria when I encountered my snake, maybe the range is undocumented? The best YouTube video of a Zebra Cobra is below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;iframe src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/RGPIHZIKf-s&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;&#34; allowfullscreen title=&#34;YouTube Video&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, even if the snake I encountered in Nigeria was not the same species of cobra (
&lt;a href=&#34;https://animaldiversity.org/accounts/Naja/classification/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;as there are several&lt;/a&gt;) it might have been a cobra.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found a photograph on Flickr of a juvenile King Cobra with stripes like the snake I found. The stripes, the color change in the mouth and under-head area, and the general head shape all fit the cobra hypothesis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;snake-bite-literature&#34;&gt;Snake bite literature&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;species-names-in-minority-languages&#34;&gt;Species names in minority languages&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Roger Blench has the most comprehensive lists of plant and animal names across the minority languages of northern Nigeria. As I understand it, he is working on publishing some of these to mobile apps. Some of these lists (usually by language) may be available 
&lt;a href=&#34;http://rogerblench.info/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;from his website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The state of online resources has also increased. I have felt that the quality of wikipedia is low and this has pushed me to discover other biodiversity based information sources. In general, online resources are not available from Tungan Magajiya due to infrastructure and internet connectivity issues. For a large variety of plant and animal species identification tasks I have found

(Both links are to &amp;ldquo;Nigeria wide&amp;rdquo; searches on the respective websites.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;publishers&#34;&gt;Publishers&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I find that the materials at 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nhbs.com&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;nhbs.com&lt;/a&gt; are generally of a good quality (in terms of depth). But there are lots of other publishers. Often one will find publications at the academic societies for the study of the family of species or at regionally focused conservation societies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;language-of-scholarship&#34;&gt;Language of Scholarship&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would like to point out that English is not the only language of scholarship — especially on matters of Africa. There are considerable resources also published in French, German, and Russian. (I have pointed to

 [German] in this post.) Arabic no-doubt also has considerable resources due to its long history of use in north and east Africa. Spanish, Italian, and Portuguese scholarship should not be overlooked. I am just not personally versed in the scope of treatment on African matters in languages other than English, German, and French.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This project includes combining and collating several U̠t-Ma&amp;rsquo;in databases that Becky Paterson has created over the 12 years she has worked with the U̠t-Ma&amp;rsquo;in language community. We are also importing as many Hausa terms as possible for specific elicitation (such as regional plants and animals). The final database includes grammatical features of individual lexemes. We are including various external analyses from phonology tools. None of this data is currently public. But when it is, a link from here will be posted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The purpose of this study was to develop a curriculum for ethnomusicological education in Nigerian elementary schools based on the integration of ethnomusicology and social studies. The aims of the curriculum were identified so as to be consistent with the aims of the Nigerian education system and in particular with the recently expressed aims of the Nigerian social studies curriculum which is intended to foster inter- and cross-ethnic communication and understanding and national identity in a country which contains more than 250 ethnic groups. A consideration of appropriate curriculum content led to the identification of five basic concepts in ethnomusicology and five concepts basic to social studies. The integration of these concepts into a unified curriculum was made through an Identity Approach which permitted the identification of relevant cognitive, affective and skill objectives and indicated appropriate learning processes. Three curriculum units were developed in detail and field tested in upper elementary classes in two elementary schools in southeastern Nigeria. This field testing—the classroom phase of the curriculum development— involved 120 students, ten teachers and the administrators of the schools. The staff were given instruction in the curriculum materials and the Identity Approach following which the students were engaged in twenty-four sessions and covered the three units which had been developed. The results of the classroom phase were studied from students&amp;rsquo;, teachers&amp;rsquo; and administrators&amp;rsquo; opinions and recommendations and their responses to four opinionaires. All responses indicated a high degree of student interest in the project and evidence of an increase in inter-and cross-ethnic understanding and respect. Teachers found the project to have contributed to their professional development and both teachers and administrators reported community interest and involvement. Problems identified by the staff and administrators related to inadequate funds and provision of materials or equipment. Administrators also noted the need for involvement by the Ministry of Education if widespread implementation were to be contemplated.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Audio Dominant Texts and Text Dominant Audio</title>
      <link>https://hughandbecky.us/Hugh-CV/post/audio-dominant-texts-and-text-dominant-audio/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 18 Mar 2013 14:35:45 +0100</pubDate>
      <guid>https://hughandbecky.us/Hugh-CV/post/audio-dominant-texts-and-text-dominant-audio/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;As linguistics and language documentation interface with digital humanities there has been a lot of effort to time-align texts and audio/video materials. At one level this is rather trivial to do and has the backing of comercial media processes like subtitles in movies. However, at another level this task is often done in XML for every project (digital corpus curation) slightly differently. At the macro-scale the argument is that if the annotation of the audio is in XML and someone wants to do something else with it, then they can just convert the XML to whatever schema they desire. This is true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, one antidotal point that I have not heard in discussion of time aligned texts is specifications for Audio Dominant Text vs. Text Dominant Audio. This may not initially seem very important, so let me explain what I mean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;audio-dominant-text&#34;&gt;Audio Dominant Text&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are those texts which were first captured orally. They are a performance. The content may be prepared (in the sense of the telling of a traditional epic), but they are not read texts. They are given from memory. The text lives. In terms of time aligned transcription, from this performance is transcribed. This oral text type stands in contrast to the &lt;em&gt;Text Dominant Audio&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;text-dominant-audio&#34;&gt;Text Dominant Audio&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Text dominant audio is where a text is read, scripted or prompted. Several examples of this exist, a radio drama, a cartoon/animated film, a reading. In linguistics a wordlist would also classify. The guiding principle is &lt;em&gt;What is guiding the audio?&lt;/em&gt; Is it the structure of the text based document or is it the image of the oral segment as it comes to the speaker spontaneously without visual or interactive reliance?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This difference should be noted in metadata durring oral text collection durring language documentation projects. In one project I was involved in, several speakers were recored who were reading texts which they had composed, written and typed. Some editorial help was provided by the PI on some of the texts. These texts now exist as both oral and written texts (in terms of modality). But is the written form a transcription? I doubt it. It is like the inverse of a transcription. The oral but these texts can be presented online similarly to Nick Thieberger’s presentation of text through EOPAS. Example: &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.eopas.org/transcripts/65&#34;&gt;http://www.eopas.org/transcripts/65&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess in terms of XML, my outstanding question is: &lt;em&gt;How should the structure be represented?&lt;/em&gt; If the reading is only a reading, then should the text be head in the XML document and the audio matched to that? Obviously some would say that even readings are performances and I do agree to an extent. However, even with these performances because the non-spontaneous nature of the delivery, and the previous editing of the text, is there a smoothing out of the text which might be equivalent to removing dialectical syntactic variation?&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The SIL archive and its two sided markets</title>
      <link>https://hughandbecky.us/Hugh-CV/post/the-sil-archive-and-its-two-sided-markets/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 03 Feb 2013 01:41:38 -0700</pubDate>
      <guid>https://hughandbecky.us/Hugh-CV/post/the-sil-archive-and-its-two-sided-markets/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have been thinking about the language data marketplace (exchange if one prefers), and the role of archives in a world where minority language speakers are also internet users and digital file consumers. In particular I have been thinking about 
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.sil.org/resources/language-culture-archives&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;SIL’s Language and Culture Archive&lt;/a&gt; and the economic model called a 
&lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-sided_market&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;two sided market&lt;/a&gt;. So, SIL as “Partners in Language Development” seems to be well situated for analysis using the two sided market analysis (matching linguist and professionals with language development skills, and persons with language development skills with interested parties in developing their language). On the surface, it seems that the SIL archive would also benefit from being the center of exchange between these same two groups. This is the subject of one of my slides for 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://hughandbecky.us/Hugh-CV/publication/2013-challenges-ramp&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;an upcoming presentation&lt;/a&gt;, therefore I sketched out the interactions various SIL staff might have with the archive to see if I could diagram the social interactions around language data in SIL’s two sided market. To my surprise, the two sided nature of access to data in the archive is not supported, thereby blocking a data-centric archiving service. It makes me wonder what the perceived value of the archive really is, and if the perceived value is low, then why bother? What is the return on investment (ROI) for users on either side of the market?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tried to summarize the relationships between the various clients of the archive in the following image.

      <title>Meꞌphaa and Sochiapam Chinantec Keyboards</title>
      <link>https://hughandbecky.us/Hugh-CV/project/2011-mexico-keyboards/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 12 Mar 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://hughandbecky.us/Hugh-CV/project/2011-mexico-keyboards/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This project formalized my interest in the text input problem. While doing text input for the Meꞌphaa language documentation project it was imperative to get Unicode encoded texts. I worked with Kevin Cline to create OS X and native Windows OS keyboards for Meꞌphaa writers.  We used 
&lt;a href=&#34;http://scripts.sil.org/ukelele&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Ukelele&lt;/a&gt; to create the OS X keyboards and  
&lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20170202084913/https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/globalization/keyboardlayouts.aspx&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Microsoft Keyboard Layout Creator (MSKLC)&lt;/a&gt; to create the Windows keyboards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upon hearing of my new found skills, language users from the Sochiapam Chinantec community asked me to make an OS X keyboard for their language. In both cases existing keyboard layouts were matched to synchronize the user experience across the OSes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the design choices in the original layouts did not make sense to me. Hence the birth of the

      <title>SEO Considerations for Linguistic Resources</title>
      <link>https://hughandbecky.us/Hugh-CV/post/seo-considerations-for-linguistic-resources/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 19 Feb 2012 14:35:45 +0100</pubDate>
      <guid>https://hughandbecky.us/Hugh-CV/post/seo-considerations-for-linguistic-resources/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;SEO for standard websites is pretty straight forward. I happen to be working on a website redesign (in Drupal) which presents Linguistic resources both published and unpublished. I recently came across two specialized SEO options which are useful:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Integration with Google Scholar&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Aggregation with 
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.language-archives.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;OLAC&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;google-scholar&#34;&gt;Google Scholar&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google Scholar’s page on getting data into Google Scholar: &lt;a href=&#34;http://scholar.google.com/intl/en/scholar/inclusion.html&#34;&gt;http://scholar.google.com/intl/en/scholar/inclusion.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;http://drupal.org/project/biblio&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Biblo&lt;/a&gt;, a module for drupal which handles bibliographic data had something 
&lt;a href=&#34;http://drupal.org/node/641580&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This blog also has an interesting write up: &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.reallywow.com/archives/123&#34;&gt;http://blog.reallywow.com/archives/123&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;olac-search&#34;&gt;OLAC Search&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This means implementing the 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.openarchives.org/pmh/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;OAI-PMH protocol&lt;/a&gt; so that OLAC can harvest it.
I am not sure how this is done exactly… but here is the link: &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.language-archives.org/&#34;&gt;http://www.language-archives.org/&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;January 4-5, 2012, I had the opportunity to participate in the LSA&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20120210164309/https://lsadc.org/info/meet-annual12-sociolinguistic.cfm&#34; title=&#34;Link to Workshop website&#34;&gt;Satellite Workshop for Sociolinguistic Archival Preparation&lt;/a&gt; in Portland, Oregon. There were a great many things I learned there. So here are only a few thoughts.
Part of the discussion at the workshop was on how we can make corpora which are collected by Sociolinguists available to the larger Sociolinguistic community. In particular the discussion I am referencing revolved around the standardisation of metadata in the corpora. (In the discussion it was established that are two levels of metadata, &amp;ldquo;event level&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;corpus level&amp;rdquo;.) While OLAC gives us some standardization about the corpus level metadata, the event metadata is still unique to each investigation, and arguably this is necessary. However, it was also pointed out that not all &amp;ldquo;event level&amp;rdquo; metadata need to be encoded or tracked uniquely. That is, data like date of recording, name of participants, location of recording, gender (male/female) of participant, can all be regularized across the community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the above as preface, it is important to realize that we do need to understand that there are still various kinds of metadata which need to be collected. In the workshop it was acknowledged that the field of &lt;em&gt;language documentation&lt;/em&gt; was about 10 years ahead of this community of sociolinguists.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; So, I will take an example from the metadata write-up I did for the Meꞌphaa language documentation project. In that project we collected metadata about:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;People&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Equipment
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Equipment settings during recording&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Locations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Recording Environments
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Times&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Situations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Linguistic Dynamics&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sociolinguistic Attitudes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the following diagram I illustrate the cross cutting of a corpus with these &amp;ldquo;kinds&amp;rdquo; of metadata. The heavier, darker line represents the corpus, while the medium heavy lines represent the &amp;ldquo;kinds&amp;rdquo; of metadata. Finally, the lighter lines represent the sub-kinds of metadata, where the sub-kinds might be the latitude, longitude, altitude, datum, country, and place name of the &lt;em&gt;location&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;


&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This does not mean that the corpus does not also need to be cross cut with these other &amp;ldquo;sub-kinds&amp;rdquo;. However, these sub-kinds are significantly more in number and will very from project to project. Some of these metadata kinds will be collected in a speaker profile questionnaire. But some of these metadata can only be provided with reflection on the event. To demonstrate the cross cutting of these metadata elements on a corpus I have provided the following diagram. It uses categories which were mentioned in the workshop and is not intended to be comprehensive. In this second diagram, the cross cutting elements might themselves be taxonomies. They may have controlled vocabularies or they may have an open set of possible values, they may also represent a scale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both of these diagrams tend to illustrate what in this workshop were referred to a &amp;ldquo;event level&amp;rdquo; metadata, rather than &amp;ldquo;corpus level&amp;rdquo; metadata.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;a-note-on-corpus-level-metadata-vs-descriptive-metadata&#34;&gt;A note on corpus level metadata v.s. descriptive metadata&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is one more thing which I would like to say about &amp;ldquo;corpus level&amp;rdquo; metadata. Metadata is often separated out by function.  That is &lt;em&gt;what does the metadata allow us to do&lt;/em&gt;, or &lt;em&gt;why is the metadata there&lt;/em&gt;?
I have been exposed to the following taxonomy of metadata types though course work and in working with photographs and images

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
. These classes of metadata are also similar to those posted by JISC Digital Media as they approach issues with Metadata for digital audio

&lt;/ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Structural meta-data&lt;/strong&gt;: maintains relationships between the parts of complex, multi-part resources

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think it is only fair to point out to archivist and to librarians that linguists and language documenters do not see a difference between descriptive and non-descriptive metadata in their workflows. That is sometimes we want to search all the corpora by licenses or by a technical attribute. This elevates the these attributes to the function of discovery metadata. It does not remove the function of descriptive metadata from its role in finding things but it does functionally mean that the other metadata is also viable as discovery metadata.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What was not well defined in the workshop was what the distinction is between a &lt;em&gt;language documentation corpus&lt;/em&gt; and a &lt;em&gt;sociolinguistics corpus&lt;/em&gt;. It seems to me as a new practitioner that the chief difference between these two types of corpora is the self identifying quality of researcher. That is does the researcher self-identify as a Sociolinguist or as a Language Documenter. Both types of corpora attempt to get at the vernacular, and both types of corpora collect sociolinguistic facts. It would seem that both corpora are essentially the same (give or take a few metadata attributes). &lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This research project was spearheaded by Ken Olson. As a collaborator with him I focused on the historical linguistics status of the interdental approximant in Philippine languages. I also did a lot of library resources discovery and acquisition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this project description I have listed more than my contribution because I am not sure there is anywhere else that has pulled together the combined research on this topic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Follow-up work&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems that the interdental approximant [ð̞] in Austronesian languages should challenge linguists in three important areas and thus deserves more thought and perhaps application in our theories. These categories are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The phonological status and interactions that happen with the segment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The phonetic contrast of the segment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Historical status of the segment and the impact of its recognition in the Austronesian historical linguistic narrative.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Publications to date have focused on two relevant aspects of the interdental approximant:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ð̞ is important in descriptive linguistics.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ð̞ is different phonetically from other described segments.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following remain to be shown clearly in appropriate publications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Phonetic contrast&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is the duration of the sound and what are the boarders?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Measure the stable section?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Where does it stop and where does it begin?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is the acoustical (in terms of both production and perception) difference between /l/ and /ð̞ /?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ulturasound study does provide a good starting point to answer these questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ð̞ it has a unique spectrograph when compared with other liquids, vowels, and interdentals - especially within the same language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ð̞ is different from the native sounds of { l, a, ɐ, n, ʔ, d, g, r, s, h, x} which occur in Philippine languages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This has been done in small phonology descriptions but not full scale acoustically reference-able phonetic descriptions across the entire set of languages discussed in the &lt;em&gt;JIPA&lt;/em&gt; article.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ð̞ is different from the borrowed sounds of { l, a, ɐ, n, ʔ, d, g, θ, ð, r, s, h, x, ɣ}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In terms of psycholinguistics the question remains,: &lt;em&gt;What are the unique properties of this sound as they are culturally defined?&lt;/em&gt; or to put this another way: &lt;em&gt;What are the acustic cues, what are the visual cues, and what are the cultural constraints that those cues may violate?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My research position suggests that there has been change. Change involves a variety of cognitive processes. Re-analysis is one such process. If I hypothesize that re-analysis has occurred, then what is the Cognitive load of this segment? How has that load shifted or why can it shift?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What are the unique properties that users attribute to this segment as cross-linguistically defined (but keeping within Austronesian or the Austro-Tai hypotheses).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What are those unique properties as Universally or empirically defined?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Historical Narrative&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is an open question with relationship to historical Austronesian as to what the metrical structure of the language was. If we posit some change in the metical structrue what relevance does that have on the interdental approximant? Does the concept of Phonetic Gemination apply?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In some theories of 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austro-Tai_languages&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Austro-Tai&lt;/a&gt; there is some relevance to constructing suprasegmental features and genisis or de-genesis processes for these features. In that contexts: &lt;em&gt;Is it possible that ð̞ is a tone bearing unit? (TBU)&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interdental is contrastive with dental in Place in the IPA Chart
ð̞ is important to PAn Historical Phonology Theory&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ð̞ is related to several mergers and splits&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ð̞ is PAn *R&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ð̞ Shows that [+Nasal], historically, is, or is/and a super-segmental feature in Austronesian languages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ð̞ shows that there are fewer proto-phonemes than necessary in current models
of PAn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ð̞ helps us to understand the PAn foot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ð̞ was represented in the baybin original orthography.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ð̞ is relevant enough to be represented consistently in orthographies in the
languages it occurs in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Phonology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are several open phonological questions. Some of these have answers in the cited materials, but the data is not always clear for all languages which also have interdental approximants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What are the claimed Phonemes of kangayen?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would be all the more the claim that ð̞ is phonemic not due to a split. If it is a retention then this perspective has more weight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is the ð̞ pattern concerning natural classes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a feature geometry perspective, what features does ð̞ have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some Austornesian language have Metathesis. Is this metathesis process triggered in any way by the ð̞?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ð̞ has moraic value - what is it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is the affect of ð̞ on vowel quality?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In what ways can we measure the impact that ð̞ has on cognitive load?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does the ð̞ occur in multiple areas of the lexicon&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To do this a survey of the texts should be used to evaluated the
location of ð̞ in the lexicon. One resource for texts could be:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What do I want to research?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why is it important?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do I want to research it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is the Problem?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is the Solution?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What do I want to Say?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is the continued importance of a feature analysis to the field of descriptive linguistics and to the field of historical linguistics and to the field of Phonology?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
