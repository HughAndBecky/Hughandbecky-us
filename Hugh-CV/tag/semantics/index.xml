      <title>Metadata Quality Assessment &amp; OLAC</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Metadata Quality is a fascinating topic that I&amp;rsquo;m interested in more professional engagement around. I am specifically interested in user-contributed metadata platforms and quality control in those digital library contexts. I have long noticed the need for spell checking and for the ability to move folksonomy terms to controlled vocabulary terms at certain archives stewarding linguistic and language resources. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I read the following three articles for UNT work:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hider, P., &amp;amp; Tan, K.-C. (2008). Constructing Record Quality Measures Based on Catalog Use. Cataloging &amp;amp; Classification Quarterly, 46(4), 338–361. &lt;a href=&#34;https://doi.org/10.1080/01639370802322515&#34;&gt;https://doi.org/10.1080/01639370802322515&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kumar, V., Maurya, S., &amp;amp; Ji, G. (2022). An Assessment of Spelling and Typographical Errors in WebOPAC of Academic Libraries. Journal of Library Metadata, 22(1–2), 63–73. &lt;a href=&#34;https://doi.org/10.1080/19386389.2022.2051978&#34;&gt;https://doi.org/10.1080/19386389.2022.2051978&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Petrucciani, A. (2015). Quality of Library Catalogs and Value of (Good) Catalogs. Cataloging &amp;amp; Classification Quarterly, 53(3–4), 303–313. &lt;a href=&#34;https://doi.org/10.1080/01639374.2014.1003669&#34;&gt;https://doi.org/10.1080/01639374.2014.1003669&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Across these articles, I really appreciate the internationally diverse perspectives brought by these authors. Kumar et al. (2022) has some really clear methodologies (I feel like I could replicate the experiment in my location) and looks at spelling mistakes in a catalog where the language of instruction (at the institution) may be English, but the first language of many (maybe most) of the people there is not English. It seems natural that there would be spelling mistakes in these environments. In the archive that I worked at (in Dallas, Tx. no less) I offered to do a spell-check analysis on titles and folksonomy terms. The staff were less than ecstatic to receive any feedback on the records as that would mean that they would need to do more work to correct them. (In that situation the archive&amp;rsquo;s catalog has central staff supporting some collections and core infrastructure, and remote staff around the world supporting location specific collections.) Depending on which collection the misspelling was found in would determine which remote staff would need to approve the changes. So I appreciate the management at the instution where Kumar and collegues did their work to have a willingness to allow this kind of research. I hope that they then engaged with the results. In the case of the archive at which I worked, they also have a remote accession tool for digital objects. I&amp;rsquo;ve suggested they add a spell check system to that tool to catch errors in the accession process, but it has been argued that those features are not mission critical. This leads back to an analysis of what are the financial priorities of the management. If an archive has no specific materials re-use objective then this could have a direct impact on the quality of the records in interesting ways. For example, an archive without a specific requirement to engage the public in innovative ways (or at all) or where this process of engagement is disjunct from cataloging, curation, and preservation activities may not seek to maintain their records in a way where potential targest would benefit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I am interested in linguistics and language resource records and their quality I found the description of the types of errors in Italian libraries interesting. Petrucciani (2015), an article which was derived from a speech given at a conference, says the following of the Italian situation (p. 304 &amp;amp; 309):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Italy, for example, the main factors may be the widespread outsourcing of cataloging activities (especially retrospective conversion and cataloging of backlogs, bequests, etc.) with very low remuneration and lack of quality control, and the participation in library networks (mainly the national network SBN, Servizio Bibliotecario Nazionale) of small libraries—public, religious, or special—run by unqualified people or volunteers, without skilled staff. In many countries, an apparent factor is the lack of competence in foreign languages among cataloging staff, resulting in wrong language coding (e.g., Spanish for Italian or vice versa, Russian for books in any language written in Cyrillic script) and the abundance of misprinted words.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These (and many more) examples are not errors. Or better, they are not simply errors. They are the result of cataloging rules and policies, of the design of OPAC interfaces, or of bibliographic formats. The low quality of large catalogs is not simply due to the vast amount of duplicated records, unprofessional work, errors of interpretation, miskeyings, and so on, but in the first place to the misunderstanding (and undervaluing) of the functions and aims of bibliographic information and to unwise cataloging standards, rules, and policies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again he attributes the errors to management practices established at institutions. In other parts of his paper Petrucciani points out that tools like Google Search and full text search options available exploit the problems that less-than-perfect catalogs have. That is, end-users for a variety of reasons turn to Google Search instead of catalog searches. I have long found interesting that Google doesn&amp;rsquo;t return results for books found in library catalogs. Its like library catalogs are part of the dark web.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found the approach by Hider and Tan (2008) inspiring. I often look at records found in the Open Language Archives Community (OLAC). One of the open questions there has been how to assess data providers and the quality of the data provided. OLAC records are often sourced from digital repositories where accessions are described by the creators/depositors. This means that variation in management practices at the data provider to OLAC impact the quality of record which OLAC has to aggregate. The current method (Hughes, 2005)  is to count the DC elements on a record, average the count on each record and assign that average to the archive to rank the data providers. In this framework quality is only measured on the basis of the syntax present in the record rather than any sort of syntax-semantics relationship. e.g., &lt;em&gt;Does a date element really contain valid date data?&lt;/em&gt; This method does not attempt to measure the validity or conformity of the data values to Dublin Core or OLAC recommendations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With regards to OLAC metadata quality, the current status quo follows the methods laid out by B. Hughes which is to count the DC elements on a record, average the count on each record and assign that average to the data provider and then to rank the data providers. In this framework &lt;em&gt;Quality&lt;/em&gt; is only measured on the basis of the syntax (number of elements) present in the record rather than any sort of syntax-semantics relationship. E.g., does a date really appear in a date field and are they really valid dates? This method does not attempt to measure the validity or conformity of the data values to Dublin Core or OALC recommendations in terms of the semantics or the well-formedness of the values. In a sense the OLAC method of quality is similar to what MARC record generators call 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.oclc.org/bibformats/en/fixedfield/elvl.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Encoding Level&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In contrast to B. Hughes&amp;rsquo; approach I have suggested that the 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.dublincore.org/specifications/dublin-core/dcmi-terms/#section-7&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;DCMIType vocabulary&lt;/a&gt; in conjunction with the &lt;code&gt;dc:format&lt;/code&gt; , &lt;code&gt;dc:relation&lt;/code&gt; , &lt;code&gt;dc:medium&lt;/code&gt; &amp;amp; &lt;code&gt;tableOfContents&lt;/code&gt; elements could be used to provide continuity checks to the type of artifact being described. The purpose here would be to check for the completeness of a description if there is evidence in the record that specific type is present. This would would be a step towards enforcing the 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.dublincore.org/resources/glossary/one-to-one_principle&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Dublin Core 1-to-1 principle&lt;/a&gt;. In a way the suggested process uses a fingerprinting process for each DCMIType. Common linguistic artifact types could be crafted (fingerprinted) and also added to the checks. These crafted fingerprints would appear in the documentation where recommendations existed for describing materials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A third method to look at quality is to look at the records that people are visiting and clicking through. People found these records and they must be interesting for some reason. An investigation of the most successful records in providing click-throughs to target websites is one way to assess the quality of a record. That is, is the record valuable to an audience? This third method of establishing quality is discussed in Hider &amp;amp; Tan (2008). They look at MARC records, but we have Dublin Core records, so some generalities and abstractions to their arguments may be needed before application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I find the idea of measuring record quality based on its use interesting. With nearly 450K records in OLAC but only some 8,000 views per month (Bird &amp;amp; Simons, 2021) a natural question arises. Which records are being viewed and are these the same ones month-over-month? Is there something &amp;ldquo;higher quality&amp;rdquo; about these records that they are being found and used? Recent work by Husic (2014) and Osborn (2019) show that adding 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.loc.gov/aba/publications/FreeLCSH/freelcsh.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Library of Congress Subject Headings (LCSH)&lt;/a&gt; to records does make them more visible to search engines. So maybe the highly used OLAC records have LCSH terms attached? This is something worth looking into and reporting on.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Some questions on the theory presented in the Dublin Core</title>
      <link>https://hughandbecky.us/Hugh-CV/post/dublin-core-theory/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 12 Oct 2022 14:35:45 +0100</pubDate>
      <guid>https://hughandbecky.us/Hugh-CV/post/dublin-core-theory/</guid>
      <description>&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems that various communities of use of the Dublin Core have understood the possibilities of the Dublin Core within their own traditions of record making. For example, when dealing with Qualified Dublin Core, librarians suggest not using both &lt;code&gt;dc:Description&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;dcterms:Abstract&lt;/code&gt;. That is, &lt;code&gt;dcterms:Abstract&lt;/code&gt; ought to be reserved for semantically valid abstracts as understood in print media. However, What is to say that &lt;code&gt;dcterms:Abstract&lt;/code&gt; can not be applied to any item qualified with any value of the DCMIType? That is, what is the abstract of a sound, software, event or physical object? This may seem absurd in some cases, but is a sound clip or a movie trailer not the same as an abstract?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dublin Core has several design principles intended for its use. Two of them are the &lt;em&gt;1-to-1 Principle&lt;/em&gt; and the &lt;em&gt;Repeatability principle&lt;/em&gt;. The question I wish to pose is &lt;em&gt;how can these two principles interact in predictable ways?&lt;/em&gt; The Repeatability principle says that any described object can have multiple instances of the same element describing a resource. For example, two or three instances of dc:subject as part of an object record makes sense. The 1-to-1 Principle says that each record should only describe one object. The 1-to-1 Principle seems rather straight forward until one faces constraints imposed by technology platforms or seeks to describe aggregate works. Setting aside the issue of describing aggregate works, &lt;em&gt;how do these principles interact when working with Qualified Dublin Core?&lt;/em&gt; That is, does the 1-to-1 Principle provide constraints to the application of the Repeatability Principle. For example, qualified &lt;code&gt;dc:type&lt;/code&gt; elements with the DCMIType vocabulary ought to only be used in their singularity. Presumably, a record with both a qualified type of &amp;ldquo;text&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;sound&amp;rdquo; each relating to different files in a &amp;ldquo;record bundle&amp;rdquo; would be in violation of the 1-to-1 Principle. For a different crazy example consider: how can a qualified &lt;code&gt;dc:type.dcmitype.sound&lt;/code&gt; also be &lt;code&gt;dc:type.dcmitype.event&lt;/code&gt;? That is, not only are there limits to via the 1-to-1 Principle, but also internal term-specific semantics of the qualified terms are limiting, but it seems that there are repeatable types of interactions which specifically limit the application of the Repeatability principle. Perhaps no terms are more in semantically incompatible than &amp;ldquo;collection&amp;rdquo; and any other term in the DCMIType vocabulary. How can something be a &amp;ldquo;collection&amp;rdquo; and also a &amp;ldquo;text&amp;rdquo; unless we are arbitrarily assigning the type text to each item within the collection. However, doing this is a violation of the practice of description that indicates that the record should only apply to a single layer of the description — presumably the entire collection at this point, so DCMIType &amp;ldquo;Collection&amp;rdquo; should not co-occur with any other DCMIType qualifier. Note, I am only speaking of situations which qualify the type element from the dcterms namespace. Obviously, &lt;code&gt;dc:type&lt;/code&gt; can be unqualified, and can also be qualified differently from different namespaces and all of these can co-exist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some thought has gone into a Dublin Core Constraint Language. See 
&lt;a href=&#34;http://web.archive.org/web/20190628022348/https://www.dublincore.org/specifications/dublin-core/dc-dsp/2008-03-31/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;the linked propsal&lt;/a&gt;. However, this seems to be taking constraints in yet another direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;3&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since a &lt;code&gt;dct:license&lt;/code&gt; value is only valid as long as copyright is also valid, and since copyright length varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, &lt;em&gt;how is the jurisdiction of the copyright registration (claim/standing) indicated?&lt;/em&gt; For further discussion on this question see: &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/dcmi/usage/issues/104&#34;&gt;https://github.com/dcmi/usage/issues/104&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What qualifier on the &amp;ldquo;date&amp;rdquo; element is used on a record which also contains a &lt;code&gt;dc:type&lt;/code&gt; element where the DCMIType qualified value is &amp;ldquo;Event&amp;rdquo;?&lt;/em&gt; It seems that date elements qualify a number of types of resources describable with the DCMIType vocabulary. However, specific dates inferring a relationship for Events are not explicitly clear. The general date element is available and the duration syntax could be used. But is this sufficient for the kinds of dates needed in regards to Event descriptions?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;How is one to indicate the script a resource is in via Dublin Core?&lt;/em&gt; One could use the language tag with a valid BCP-47 tag but this is not mentioned in the usage guide. (One would need to indicate either RFC4646 or RFC5646 as the refinement of language.) If am I to correctly understand the situation, new approved syntaxes have crept into DC/DCT usage over time via the language tag recommendations as the IETF approves new language tag related RFCs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To prevent this from happening maybe the DC Usage board can just define a syntax for BCP-47 which will remain a stable pointer without needing to invoke a specific RFC defined syntax. BCP-47 has in the past pointed to each of RFC1766, RFC3066, RFC4646, RFC5646. Each progressive standard in the BCP-47 series does not invalidate the next set of codes but rather adds specification. All RFC1766 tags are valid RFC5646 tags, but not all RFC5646 tags are valid RFC1766 tags. However all RFC1766 tags and all RFC1766 tags are valid BCP-47 tags. As I understand things, by pointing to RFC5646 rather than BCP-47 it does not allow for the implementation of RFC6067 and RFC6497 within the narrowly interpreted syntax of RFC5646. RFC5646 allows for 35 subtags with in the BCP-47 space, RFC6067 and RFC6497 define two of these without changing the syntax of the BCP-47 tag scheme. It&amp;rsquo;s just that when narrowly understood, RFC5646, now doesn&amp;rsquo;t include all of BCP-47.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My thought is that it might be possible to just define BCP-47 as a syntax and if additional sub-tags are registered then there is no-need on the part of DCMI to update the number of syntaxes DC/DCT count as valid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;6&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dublin Core does not specify a specific syntax. Therefore it must get its syntax from an application profile, a specific instanciation of defined community agreements. When the syntax is XML, the exact nature of the allowable elements and attributes may vary based on the namespaces declared in the header. Therefore I have a general question about the use of the &lt;code&gt;xsi:type=&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt; attribute in XML, as the &lt;code&gt;xsi&lt;/code&gt; namespaces is often declared in Dublin Core application profiles. &lt;strong&gt;Do values of &lt;code&gt;xsi:type=&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt; need to be namespaced?&lt;/strong&gt;  The Open Language Archive application profiles (based on Dublin Core and OAI: therefore XML) uses namespaced values such as &lt;code&gt;xsi:type=&amp;quot;olac:role&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt;.  So what happens if I just use &lt;code&gt;role&lt;/code&gt; without namespacing it? I had this issue come up in some other dublin core project and I couldn&amp;rsquo;t get a clear answer. That project doesn&amp;rsquo;t namespace &lt;code&gt;xsi:type=&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt; values and I suggested that those non-namespaced values shouldn&amp;rsquo;t validate&amp;hellip; but then project owners said: &amp;ldquo;oh the code validates just fine&amp;rdquo;&amp;hellip;. but I&amp;rsquo;m thinking that it syntactically validates as valid XML but does not validate against a schema. The second thing I was thinking was where does the &lt;code&gt;xsi:type=&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt; validate against when there is no namespace? An OLAC (or any OAI based aggregator) security concern would be to close this gap and force all &lt;code&gt;xsi:type=&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt; uses to namespace as a required practice. ELSE fail a required validation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book &lt;em&gt;XML in a Nutshell&lt;/em&gt; says the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;xsi:type&lt;/strong&gt;
The xsi:type attribute may be used in instance documents to indicate the type of an element, even when a full schema is not available. For example, this length element has type xs:decimal : &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;length xsi:type=&amp;quot;xs:decimal&amp;quot;&amp;gt;23.5&amp;lt;/length&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; More importantly, the xsi:type attribute enables a limited form of polymorphism. That is, it allows you to make an element an instance of a derived type where an instance of the base type would normally be expected. The instance of the derived type must carry an xsi:type attribute identifying it as an instance of the derived type. For example, suppose a schema says that a ticket element has type TicketType . If the schema also defines BusTicketType and AirplaneTicketType elements as subtypes of TicketType , then a ticket element could also use the BusTicketType and AirplaneTicketType content models provided it had an &lt;code&gt;xsi:type=&amp;quot;BusTicketType&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt; or
&lt;code&gt;xsi:type=&amp;quot;AirplaneTicketType&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt; attribute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But here again what if &lt;code&gt;AirplaneTicketType&lt;/code&gt; is not defined in the base schema?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This sort of question seems to have been asked on 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20245364/to-which-xml-namespace-does-an-unqualified-name-in-an-xsitype-attribute-belong&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;stack exchange&lt;/a&gt; where it is pointed out that in the

      <title>OLAC in Search Results</title>
      <link>https://hughandbecky.us/Hugh-CV/post/olac-in-search-results/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 12 Sep 2022 14:35:45 +0100</pubDate>
      <guid>https://hughandbecky.us/Hugh-CV/post/olac-in-search-results/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;On the second page of recent paper by Bird and Simons (2021) one can find the following quote:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alongside these contributions of OLAC is the response from the community, including over 5,000 publications that cite OLAC (&lt;a href=&#34;https://scholar.Google.com/scholar?q=&#34;&gt;https://scholar.Google.com/scholar?q=&lt;/a&gt; &amp;ldquo;OLAC&amp;quot;+language). There is evidence that OLAC is enabling research that accesses language resources (e.g. [13]), and that OLAC is supporting ongoing scholarship on language archiving itself (e.g. [8, 9]).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a scholar with a subject interest in the Open Language Archives Community aggregator, I was immediately interested in this claim. I wanted to verify it. In fact it is my conclusion that the actual body of literature mentioning OLAC is much smaller. In my experience, the publications which do mention OLAC, do so in a passing way, rather diving deep into any sort of theory, design, or application oriented discussion of either the aggregator service or the metadata schema. This leaves the field wide open for investigative research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided to have a look at Bird and Simons&amp;rsquo; claims and I find fewer resources given that there is a significant amount of noise in the search results. Noise is introduced from the following terms:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ohio Leadership Advisory Council&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;OLAC, inc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Online Audio Visual Catalogers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Olac&lt;/em&gt; is a name.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ohio Latin Americanist Conference&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Online Learning Advisery Community&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Outdoor lighting Application Center&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Online Accelerated Cooling&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There also seems to be room for the following names:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open Literature Access Community&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open Linguistic Anthropology Consortium&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open Language Activist Community&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I did my search as indicated in their paper:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;5570 hits.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Numerous items are duplicates.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My results are narrowed to 30 when I exclude the string &lt;code&gt;language-archives.org&lt;/code&gt;  This is problematic as the strings do legitimately co-occur.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If we assume that there are 5570 hits then we might also assume that for each legitimate work there are at least two expressions: a pre-print and a published version. This reduces the number of works to 2785. I still think that 2800 items is too many for referencing the Open Language Archives Community.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my readings OLAC is widely mentioned within the areas of scholarly communication involving:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;in early publications of E-MELD by participants of E-MELD.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CLARIN work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dr. Nick Thieberger Set up no less than four archives.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dr. Steven Bird set up no less than 8 archives.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dr. Gary Simons set up and consulted on no less than three archives.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Papers announcing new archive feeds.&lt;/li&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am writing a paper on describing services with Dublin Core. As I do this, it seems smart to keep a list of issues that I and/or others have had with regards to Dublin Core. Such a list might include things I would like to see changed in Dublin Core.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rights does not have a Jurisdiction refinement. Something may be in Copyright, but copyright terms vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Identifier element does not have a common set of refinements.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Names do not have a way to define an order — though this can be partly to blame on software implementations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Names do not have a way to define differences in family vs. given names and similar concepts in other cultures.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Collection type vocabulary is not part of the official standard. (Why not make it part of the official standard? Its optional just like the DCMIType vocabulary, but would get more visibility and traction.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Accrual vocabulary is not part of the official standard. (Why not make it part of the official standard? Its optional just like the DCMIType vocabulary, but would get more visibility and traction.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Other library of congress subject or type vocabularies are not available (or maybe they shouldn’t be)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is no current way of saying BCP47 is the standard for language tag use.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Services do not have a way of overtly identifying the language of the user interface in addition to the language of the data acted upon (input) and language of the output.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lissonet has some interesting discussion in her dissertation on the issue of limitations in Dublin Core.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;great examples for dates (epochs).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;great examples where place names have not become part of a formal registry.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;issues with format, medium and suggesting that those should be part of description.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;great examples about Rights permissions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I don&amp;rsquo;t agree with all of the exampels Lissonnet puts forward, I do think that some of these are worth exploring in other contexts outside of the where she is primarily working. Some of these issues are re-stated in the short paper. Simons I believe mentions the issue with the names. While person id&amp;rsquo;s and identifier types are acknowleged in various places such as schema.org and Dublin Core forums and community groups.&lt;/p&gt;
