      <title>Converting FLExText Files to XLingPaper Interlinear Texts</title>
      <link>https://hughandbecky.us/Hugh-CV/post/flextext-to-xlingpaper/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s assume that we have a generous friend who has gifted us an interlinearized text from FLEx with morpheme level glossing in the format of &lt;code&gt;.flextext&lt;/code&gt;. (&lt;code&gt;.flextext&lt;/code&gt; is an XML formated file.) And lets say we want to type set that file in XLingPaper. How can we do that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One might be tempted to import the &lt;code&gt;.flextext&lt;/code&gt; file into FLEx so that it can be re-exported with the XLingPaper exports from the FLEx menus, but this is not really a viable option becasue if we import that FLExText to an empty FLEx database, FLEx will not import the morpheme level annotations — it will recognize the free-translation and the baseline text. Bascially anything which is related to the lexicon part of the database is not viewable in the imported database.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However all is not lost we can use the XSLT transforms from FLEx by copying them to a usable location as the data start of those transforms is also &lt;code&gt;.flextext&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I run linux. On the command line I used &lt;code&gt;locate&lt;/code&gt; to find the XSL file titled &lt;code&gt;xml2XLingPapConcatMorphemes.xsl&lt;/code&gt; with &lt;code&gt;$ locate xml2XLingPapConcat&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It appeared on my comptuer at &lt;code&gt;/usr/share/fieldworks/Language Explorer/Export Templates/Interlinear/xml2XLingPapConcatMorphemes.xsl&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To run these transforms I was advised to use Saxon. Saxon is already installed on linux if XLingPaper is installed. Saxon comes with XMLMind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also used &lt;code&gt;locate&lt;/code&gt; to find the Saxon file with &lt;code&gt;$ locate saxon&lt;/code&gt;
Mine was located at: &lt;code&gt;/opt/xxe-perso-7_6_0/bin/saxon.jar&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The basic syntax for operating Saxon is as follows:
&lt;code&gt;java -cp &amp;quot;wherever_saxon.jar_is/saxon.jar&amp;quot; com.icl.saxon.StyleSheet the_flextext_file path_to_the XSLT_files/\xml2XLingPapConcatMorphemes.xsl  &amp;gt; the_XLingPaper_output_file.xml&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I then needed to change where I told Saxon the files were located. In my case I coppied the &lt;code&gt;.xsl&lt;/code&gt; files to their own folder within my project folder for simpler operation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are other &lt;code&gt;.xsl&lt;/code&gt; files for transforming FLExTexts to interlinear files in XLingPaper. These can be seen by using &lt;code&gt;locate&lt;/code&gt; or in the official repo:
Check for the other files in the official FLEx repo at: &lt;a href=&#34;https://gerrit.lsdev.sil.org/admin/repos/FieldWorks,&#34;&gt;https://gerrit.lsdev.sil.org/admin/repos/FieldWorks,&lt;/a&gt; or specifically look at XLingPaper export xsl transforms as discussed in their origional merge into the FLEx project: &lt;a href=&#34;https://gerrit.lsdev.sil.org/c/FieldWorks/+/1961&#34;&gt;https://gerrit.lsdev.sil.org/c/FieldWorks/+/1961&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>PDFs from Webpages</title>
      <link>https://hughandbecky.us/Hugh-CV/post/pdfs-of-webpages/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 15 Jan 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://hughandbecky.us/Hugh-CV/post/pdfs-of-webpages/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the course of writing a paper I needed to take screen shots of webpages and include those as figures in the paper. I could take a screenshot save it as a .png or .jpg and call it good. However these sorts of images do not provide a great deal of resolution and do not look clean in a published paper. Especially when dealing with screenshots as the resolution is not very high — at least in my experince. I could print the web page to PDF but a post-script style PDF would basically create an image and wrap it in a PDF. This is not really any better than the screenshot solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a quick internet search I uncovered two potential solutions: 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://wkhtmltopdf.org&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;wkhtmltopdf&lt;/a&gt; and 
&lt;a href=&#34;http://cssbox.sourceforge.net/webvector/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;WebVector/CSSBox&lt;/a&gt;. I decided to try out &lt;code&gt;wkhtmltopdf&lt;/code&gt;. It was simple and easy to install on linux. It produces great resutls with a bit of tinkering (
&lt;a href=&#34;https://wkhtmltopdf.org/usage/wkhtmltopdf.txt&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;manual here&lt;/a&gt;). Though it should be noted that &lt;code&gt;wkhtmltopdf&lt;/code&gt; is based on webkit which has mostly not seen progressive development. I also tried WebVector (specifically on the website Pangloss) and it did not produce expected results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Playing around with wkhtmltopdf I was able to produce a PDF of several webpages I was looking to include. I used the following workflow after install:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I adjusted my screen size to fit the type of display I wanted. Then I measured it via 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://whatismyviewport.com&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;whatismyviewport.com&lt;/a&gt;. I took that and made it my viewport size. Then I played around with my output settings for the PDF. I knew that I wanted really low margins because I was going to embed this PDF as a figure in another PDF. Then I continued to play around with the page size to find the cut-off point between the content I wanted and the footer.
In the end the code I used looked like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;wkhtmltopdf --no-print-media-type --viewport-size 1100 --page-height 6.25in --page-width 7.75in -T 1mm -B 1mm -R 1mm -L 1mm --load-media-error-handling skip --enable-javascript --javascript-delay 2000 https://www.sil.org/resources/archives/52216 sil-item.pdf&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;wkhtmltopdf --no-print-media-type --viewport-size 1100 --page-height 8in --page-width 7.75in -T 1mm -B 1mm -R 1mm -L 1mm --load-media-error-handling skip --enable-javascript --javascript-delay 2000 https://scholarspace.manoa.hawaii.edu/handle/10125/30788 K-item.pdf&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;wkhtmltopdf --no-print-media-type --viewport-size 1100 --page-height 8.75in --page-width 7in -T 1mm -B 1mm -R 1mm -L 1mm --load-media-error-handling skip --enable-javascript --javascript-delay 2000 http://www.language-archives.org/item/oai:sil.org:52216 olac-item1.pdf&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This produced a nice PDF. But I needed to get rid of the second page. I did this with PDF-Shuffler and just deleted the second page.
I wanted to include the final PDF in XLingPaper which uses XeLaTeX on the back end. However one of the current dependencies only allows PDFs of version 1.4 or older. So I had to &amp;ldquo;back version&amp;rdquo; the PDF version to 1.4. I the following code (adjustin for file names) to do that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;gs -q -sDEVICE=pdfwrite -dCompatibilityLevel=1.4 -o out.pdf in.pdf&lt;/code&gt; &lt;!-- https://superuser.com/questions/25598/linux-pdf-version-converter --&gt;
My suspicion though is that passing the PDF through GhostSript also removes some of the mark-up features which already exist in the PDF via &lt;code&gt;wkhtmltopdf&lt;/code&gt;. This may include some of the links and embedded fonts — but on this last point I am not 100 percent sure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an earlier version of this workflow I was using standard size pages (A4, A3, etc.). Doing so required that I then cut the PDF so that the usable portion was able to usefully be scaled in xlingpaper. To do this I used 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://pdfresizer.com&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;pdfresizer.com&lt;/a&gt; to reduce the physical dimensions of pdf paes. However this was not necessary to maintain because I was able to specify the dimentions I needed directly in &lt;code&gt;wkhtmltopdf&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
