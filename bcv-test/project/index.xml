&lt;a href=&#34;https://sites.google.com/view/speechreporting/home?authuser=0&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Discourse reporting in African storytelling&lt;/a&gt; is a collaborative project hosted at CNRS-LLACAN, Villejuif, France. With 20 project team members and collaborators, we are interested in traditional oral storytelling practices across West Africa. Specifically, we are investigating the relationship between specific discourse patterns and the linguistic strategies they rely on in quoted speech and other reported speech environments.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>u̱t-Maꞌin predication</title>
      <link>https://hughandbecky.us/bcv-test/project/ut-main-predication/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;While investigating verb forms, it became apparent that a lot of tense/aspect/mood designations in U̱t-Maꞌin involve complex structures beyond verb affixation. This project looks at the auxiliaries that are used to convey a wide range of meanings, where the main semantic verb is in nominalized form and bears noun phrase morphology. This auxiliary-plus-nominal-complement structure has grammaticalized to varying degrees for the different auxiliaries. Other topics explored include nonverbal, existential, and possessive predication as well as negation of the various clause types.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>u̱t-Maꞌin verb research</title>
      <link>https://hughandbecky.us/bcv-test/project/ut-main-verb-research/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 10 Aug 2012 09:30:22 -0700</pubDate>
      <guid>https://hughandbecky.us/bcv-test/project/ut-main-verb-research/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this study, I investigated the distribution of verb forms and the discourse function of those verb forms in U̱t-Maꞌin narratives. The primary focus was the use of what I call the “Bare Verb” form for both present/habitual functions and for past time interpretation within the main event line of a narrative discourse. The function of the Bare Verb form is one of interpretive dependence on the discourse context. In this respect the Bare Verb form is similar to some of functions of the null verb form described for Wolof (Atlantic). Due to its textual interpretive dependence, the U̱t-Maꞌin Bare Verb form never occurs as the first verb of a narrative event sequence, though the clauses it occurs in have all other components of finite main clause syntax (and the Bare Verb can clearly occur independently as the single verb form in a stand-alone utterance). The Bare Verb form is not a case of a grammatical form specifically devoted to narrative sequence; but the U̱t-Maꞌin language does use sequenced Bare Verb forms as a strategy to further the narrative without need to reset the temporal, aspectual, or mood scenario for the listener (as well as other functions).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data for this project was collected in collaboration with local speakers. One text was transcribed, glossed, translated, and annotated. Seven texts were transcribed in the u̱t-Maꞌin orthography, translated, and annotated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The texts are as indicated below:&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>SIL Americas Area Professional Development Platform</title>
      <link>https://hughandbecky.us/bcv-test/project/sil-americas-area-professional-development-platform/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 10 Aug 2010 09:30:22 -0700</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Cornerstone OnDemand is a software as service platform which helps organizations facilitate the professional development of their staff. SIL Americas Area was in a state of transition. The organization had realized that its 800 member staff was heavily weighted towards retirement age, the acquisition rate of new staff would not compensate for the loss of specific knowledge about languages in the Americas or the innate knowledge about organizational structures. SIL Americas Area had a talent retention crisis — due to an aging workforce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Organizational leadership needed a platform to track the projected talent needed to accomplish organizational goals. The ability to track opportunities for talent development based on the current and projected projects the organization was involved with. And also track the staff who desired to grow in capabilities in which the organization was projected to need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My role was to acquire and implement a software as service solution. I elicited bids and fielded reviews of serveral SASS products, and chose  Cornerstone OnDemand. I then worked with their foundation to scale and match their offerings to SIL&amp;rsquo;s needs and budget.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Mòoré research</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Over the course of a full academic year 2013-2014, in the context of a doctoral level field methods course sequence, I collected various data from the Moore (Gur) language. Our cohort of 10 doctoral student researchers shared data and analysis over the 9 month period, as we each focussed on slightly different aspects of the language. Data included high-fidelity recordings of wordlists, elicited sentences, (prompted) texts, personal narratives, and other text types. Areas investigated included phonetics, morphology and syntax, applying knowledge of language typology and universals to the elicitation, analysis and evaluation of the data. Dekereke, Fieldworks Language Explorer, and ELAN were used to aid analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Pipero research</title>
      <link>https://hughandbecky.us/bcv-test/project/pipero-research/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 10 Aug 2007 09:30:22 -0700</pubDate>
      <guid>https://hughandbecky.us/bcv-test/project/pipero-research/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Working alongside members of the Pero community from the two principal towns, Gwandum and Filiya, we reviewed previously published linguistic descriptions (1980s) and translated materials (1930s). Their goals included identifying areas for improving the orthography, developing a writing system for the contemporary language, testing that orthography in the community, and translating materials into the Pipero language. We produced a trial version of a transitional literacy book that allowed Pipero speakers who are already literate in Hausa or English to learn the proposed Pipero orthography. We also produced several booklets that were tested by the speaker/translators in their communities. The project continued after my involvement (which ended in 2007) and they have since translated the Gospel of Luke from the Christian New Testament and the and the script of the JESUS film based on the Gospel of Luke. The script was recorded and dubbed to the original English film which can be

      <title>u̱t-Maꞌin noun research</title>
      <link>https://hughandbecky.us/bcv-test/project/ut-main-noun-research/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 10 Aug 2007 09:30:22 -0700</pubDate>
      <guid>https://hughandbecky.us/bcv-test/project/ut-main-noun-research/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The U̱t-Maꞌin language is characterized by a complex noun classification system and a robust agreement system that permeates the language. While an understanding of the noun classes is essential to an understanding of the language as a whole, discussion includes the division of nouns into fourteen distinct classes, marked by prefixes on the nouns themselves and by agreement elements on other clause constituents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Five of fourteen noun class prefixes are involved in nominalization of the verb; a nominalized verb, along with a goal complement or an object, can be incorporated into the nominalized phrase in the same way that a noun modifier is marked within a NP. These nominalized verb phrases are extensively used in auxiliary constructions that cover a diverse range of tense, aspect, and mode designations; the syntactic transitivity of the clause determines the morphosyntax used. Intransitive auxiliary constructions use the full range of nominalizing noun class marking; in contrast, transitive auxiliary constructions show a shift in their use of the noun class agreement morphology required.&lt;/p&gt;
