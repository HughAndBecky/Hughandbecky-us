The primary focus was the use of what I call the “Bare Verb” form for both present/habitual functions and for past time interpretation within the main event line of a narrative discourse. The function of the Bare Verb form is one of interpretive dependence on the discourse context. In this respect the Bare Verb form is similar to some of functions of the null verb form described for Wolof (Atlantic). Due to its textual interpretive dependence, the U̱t-Maꞌin Bare Verb form never occurs as the first verb of a narrative event sequence, though the clauses it occurs in have all other components of finite main clause syntax (and the Bare Verb can clearly occur independently as the single verb form in a stand-alone utterance). The Bare Verb form is not a case of a grammatical form specifically devoted to narrative sequence; but the U̱t-Maꞌin language does use sequenced Bare Verb forms as a strategy to further the narrative without need to reset the temporal, aspectual, or mood scenario for the listener (as well as other functions).\nData for this project was collected in collaboration with local speakers.

While an understanding of the noun classes is essential to an understanding of the language as a whole, discussion includes the division of nouns into fourteen distinct classes, marked by prefixes on the nouns themselves and by agreement elements on other clause constituents.\nFive of fourteen noun class prefixes are involved in nominalization of the verb; a nominalized verb, along with a goal complement or an object, can be incorporated into the nominalized phrase in the same way that a noun modifier is marked within a NP. These nominalized verb phrases are extensively used in auxiliary constructions that cover a diverse range of tense, aspect, and mode designations; the syntactic transitivity of the clause determines the morphosyntax used. Intransitive auxiliary constructions use the full range of nominalizing noun class marking; in contrast, transitive auxiliary constructions show a shift in their use of the noun class agreement morphology required.\n","date":1186763422,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1186763422,"objectID":"5c2b0d2f578ee20aa3141e5fb2c9afde","permalink":"https://hughandbecky.us/bcv-test/project/ut-main-noun-research/","publishdate":"2007-08-10T09:30:22-07:00","relpermalink":"/bcv-test/project/ut-main-noun-research/","section":"project","summary":"Complex morphology and agreement patterns within the NP and beyond.","tags":["u̱t-Maꞌin noun research","Grammar","Nigeria","Kanji"],"title":"u̱t-Maꞌin noun research","type":"project"},{"authors":["Rebecca Dow Smith"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1172050223,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1172050223,"objectID":"ab83aa814d3ecc844986091da55e4810","permalink":"https://hughandbecky.us/bcv-test/publication/2007-thesis/","publishdate":"2007-02-21T01:30:23-08:00","relpermalink":"/bcv-test/publication/2007-thesis/","section":"publication","summary":"A comprehensive overview of the noun class system of u̱t-Maꞌin including the morphosyntax of the noun phrase and the use of both prefixes and suffixes on nouns and agreement targets.

I used this list as the basis for my investigation into the noun classes of u̱t‑Maꞌin. I started work in 2005 in Tungun Magajiya. But the list was mostly transcribed, checked and recorded between February 2006 and March 2007 in Jos. A typed version of this wordlist appears as an appendix in my M. A. thesis. I provide here a scan done in 2017 of my hand written work during elicitation. I have audio recordings, but these are not prepared for sharing at this time.\nContext and consent Most of the audio recordings for the 1700 wordlist were made in December 2006 with Sunday John at ELM House, Jos. Sunday’s wife Serah was also present during the checking and recording preparation. Sunday and Serah each signed a consent form stating that the data collected could be used for my MA thesis specifically and that the data could be used for further academic research. Further, they agreed that the recordings themselves could be shared for academic purposes. The data was collected under the University of North Dakota IRB Project # IRB-200601-006\nSunday and Serah are both u̱t‑MaꞌRor speakers, who lived in Tungun Magajiya, Niger State.\nTechnology used Recordings were made on a Mini-disc recorder with proprietary Sony software. The software allowed only one retrieval of the file. That file in its proprietary file format was retrieved and then “converted” to a .wav file. The WAV file was cut into the files for each numerical item of the 1700 wordlist. Audacity was used to cut and save the individual word files.\n Bibliography   Snider, Keith L \u0026amp; James S Roberts. 2006. SIL comparative African wordlist (SILCAWL).
