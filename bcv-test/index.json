Friendly competition keeps speakers involved in what could otherwise be a dull task of listing words. New participants seek out the opportunity to be involved in the future as participants when positive engagement attitudes are developed. To this end, we applied principles of gamification (Hamari et al. 2014) to the Rapid Word collection phase of the Dictionary Development Program (DDP) (Shore \u0026 van den Berg 2006; Moe 2004).\nWe present the outcomes of applying gamification to the DDP in an effort to collect and verify words in a narrow set of semantic domains for the Mòòré language [[mos](https://iso639-3.sil.org/code/mos)]. Mòòré is widely spoken, underdocumented Gur language primarily spoken in Burkina Faso. Data was collected by native speakers of Mòòré on a university campus.\nThe basic procedure for the game is as follows:\nIn round 1, two teams of 3-4 speakers compete with each other in attempt to accumulate more words than the other team in each semantic domain as it is presented. Each team appoints a scribe equipped with paper and pen who records words in the existing Mòòré orthography; other team members participate verbally. Points accrue for words that are collected that are distinct from the other team, i.e. unique words will score points. In round 2, the teams exchange sets of words and must use the words compiled by the other team in round 1 to make sentences in the language that exemplify the meaning of the word. Round 2 verifies the words and offers some idea that shared meaning exists between the speakers on the two competing teams.\nWe present a methodology involving multiple speakers that appears to be effective and efficient, compared to elicitation of terms with one speaker in the same time frame. At the same time, we show the possibility of collecting discourse data as participants negotiate amongst themselves key definitions and example sentences. In post-game interviews with participants, we also asked speakers about their reactions to the task, and the likelihood of them participating again, though it remains to be seen if they will participate again.\n_References:_\nHamari, Juho, Jonna Koivisto, \u0026 Harri Sarsa. 2014. _Does Gamification Work? – A Literature Review of Empirical Studies on gamification_.

Few would dispute this. Exactly how we validate women in the work of language documentation is not often overtly stated. We report on some contributions women make to the linguistic vitality and documentation of Kainji languages of northwestern Nigeria through (1) their contributions to the corpus of recorded data, (2) their role in intergenerational transmission and (3) their interactions with a female researcher in non- mixed gender environments, which often results in more confidence for the female speaker and more data for the researcher. By acknowledging their successes, how can we as researchers assist women to make their greatest contribution?\nEach field situation has its challenges for the researcher; here we share lessons learned and methods for successful interaction with women in societies of northwestern Nigeria based on observations of behavior, interviews with local families and elicitation sessions in both female only and mixed gender settings. Intermarriage between neighboring language groups is common; society is multilingual. On average, women speak two languages while men speak three or four. Paths of intergenerational transmission of the minority languages follow the mother-child relationship while paths of intergenerational transmission of trade languages follow the father-child relationship. As a result children often speak the minority language of their mother and to their mother, and they often interact with their father in Hausa and English, particularly along roadside settlements. Domains of language use are limited by areas of knowledge, and that knowledge transmission becomes directly tied to the language choice of the transmitter.\nIn mixed-gender elicitation environments, women are not silent, but they are not free to speak as they would in an all female environment. The female researcher benefits from interacting in non-mixed gender environments, which often results in more confidence for the female speaker and more data for the researcher. More data from female speakers enriches a corpus and the record of the language for future generations.\nBy integrating this new knowledge concerning the existing contributions of women, we can develop new expectations for the future contribution of women in language development and enlist them more readily in the tasks of documentation and maintenance.","tags":["Language Documentation","Human Gender","Gender in Society","Nigeria"],"title":"Contribution of women to linguistic vitality in northwestern Nigeria","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Rebecca Paterson"],"categories":["Peer Reviewed"],"content":"Comments: The content of this publication was first presented at SLE 2013.\n","date":1424539427,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1424539427,"objectID":"f72bb962709b85b605f8e256ec495159","permalink":"https://hughandbecky.us/Becky-CV/publication/2015-narrative-uses-of-utmatin-bare-verb/","publishdate":"2015-02-21T09:23:47-08:00","relpermalink":"/Becky-CV/publication/2015-narrative-uses-of-utmatin-bare-verb/","section":"publication","summary":"A discourse based study of the distribution of verb forms in narrative texts with focus on the “unmarked” Bare Verb form that is used to progress the storyline — sequential main events in a narrative text.","tags":["Bare Verb","Kainji","Verbs","Unmarked","Un-inflected","Narrative"],"title":"Narrative uses of the U̱t‑Maꞌin (Kainji) Bare Verb form","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Sara Pacchiarotti","Rebecca Paterson","Amos Teo"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1424419764,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1424419764,"objectID":"9784fa1183dd38a1490892d98b01a4fc","permalink":"https://hughandbecky.us/Becky-CV/publication/2015-describing-moore/","publishdate":"2015-02-20T00:09:24-08:00","relpermalink":"/Becky-CV/publication/2015-describing-moore/","section":"publication","summary":"An overview of the sounds, words, and clauses of Mòòré language.","tags":["Mòóre","Fieldwork"],"title":"Describing Mòòré: a language of Burkina Faso","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1397685600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1397685600,"objectID":"7294d7f33b46194f9792c1bef43701db","permalink":"https://hughandbecky.us/Becky-CV/talk/2014-verbal-categories-in-utmain/","publishdate":"2014-04-17T00:00:00+02:00","relpermalink":"/Becky-CV/talk/2014-verbal-categories-in-utmain/","section":"talk","summary":"A recent study (Nurse et al. 2010) surveyed Niger-Congo verbal categories. However, no data from Kainji languages was included quite likely because very little on Kainji languages has been researched or published. This paper offers data from U̠t-Ma'in [[gel](https://iso639-3.sil.org/code/gel)], a Kainji language, spoken in Kebbi State and Niger State, Nigeria. Additional comparative verbal morphology data is presented from closely related languages, C’Lela [[dri](https://iso639-3.sil.org/code/dri)] and U̠t-Hun [[dud](https://iso639-3.sil.org/code/dud)]. U̠t-Ma'in employs verbal suffixes, a series of pre-verb auxiliaries and nominalizations to express the various tense and aspect categories of the language. Within the auxiliary paradigm, there is a three way tense distinction: past imperfective, present imperfective and future. The suffixed verb morphology paradigm shows only a two way tense distinction: past versus non-past.\n(1)ɘ̄ mrɛ́ -g-ɘ̄ nsāpɘ  zwɘ̄ g ɘ̄ r1 SG eat- PST - DISTriceLOCZuru.town‘I ate rice in Zuru (before coming here)’\nThe suffixing paradigm expresses additional aspectual meanings for past forms, which include perfective interpretations along with distance (1), affectedness of the object, and exclusiveness of the subject (2), which emphasizes that only the referent of the subject pronoun/noun is capable of or subject to the predicate. To my knowledge, this type of exclusivity of the subject has not been described as a verbal category within an aspect system.\n(2)újɘ̄ n-ɛhɔ̀ g-d-ɘ̀ -mɛ C 1.3 SGleave- EXCLhear- C 5- ASSOC -6 M -shame‘(Only) he left ashamed.’\n_References:_\nNurse, Derek, John Hewson \u0026 Sarah Rose.

Seven retellings were by speakers of the Ror variety (3 women, 4 men). Two retellings in additional varieties were also recorded: 1 male speaker from the northernmost variety, Kuur, and 1 male speaker from the southernmost variety, Juur. A short wordlist was also collected from each speaker.\nEach participant (speaker A) watched the Pear Film video, then a second speaker (speaker B) prompted speaker A by asking the question “What did you see in the video?” or “Tell me what happened.” Speaker A then told what they recalled from the video to speaker B who had not yet seen the video. The interactions, which proved to be dynamic, were recorded in audio and video.\nThese retellings were added to my ongoing research on u̱t‑Maꞌin grammar in order to better understand differences that may exist across speakers and language varieties. The “Retelling” genre also emerged as distinct from other narratives (folk/proverbial and personal). For example, all nine retellings made use of a patterned tail-head linkage that is not attested in folk narratives or personal narratives.\nNo Pear Film retellings were collected for the Us, Zuksun, or Fer varieties.

The primary focus was the use of what I call the “Bare Verb” form for both present/habitual functions and for past time interpretation within the main event line of a narrative discourse. The function of the Bare Verb form is one of interpretive dependence on the discourse context. In this respect the Bare Verb form is similar to some of functions of the null verb form described for Wolof (Atlantic). Due to its textual interpretive dependence, the U̱t-Maꞌin Bare Verb form never occurs as the first verb of a narrative event sequence, though the clauses it occurs in have all other components of finite main clause syntax (and the Bare Verb can clearly occur independently as the single verb form in a stand-alone utterance). The Bare Verb form is not a case of a grammatical form specifically devoted to narrative sequence; but the U̱t-Maꞌin language does use sequenced Bare Verb forms as a strategy to further the narrative without need to reset the temporal, aspectual, or mood scenario for the listener (as well as other functions).\nData for this project was collected in collaboration with local speakers.

While an understanding of the noun classes is essential to an understanding of the language as a whole, discussion includes the division of nouns into fourteen distinct classes, marked by prefixes on the nouns themselves and by agreement elements on other clause constituents.\nFive of fourteen noun class prefixes are involved in nominalization of the verb; a nominalized verb, along with a goal complement or an object, can be incorporated into the nominalized phrase in the same way that a noun modifier is marked within a NP. These nominalized verb phrases are extensively used in auxiliary constructions that cover a diverse range of tense, aspect, and mode designations; the syntactic transitivity of the clause determines the morphosyntax used. Intransitive auxiliary constructions use the full range of nominalizing noun class marking; in contrast, transitive auxiliary constructions show a shift in their use of the noun class agreement morphology required.\n","date":1186763422,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1186763422,"objectID":"5c2b0d2f578ee20aa3141e5fb2c9afde","permalink":"https://hughandbecky.us/Becky-CV/project/ut-main-noun-research/","publishdate":"2007-08-10T09:30:22-07:00","relpermalink":"/Becky-CV/project/ut-main-noun-research/","section":"project","summary":"Complex morphology and agreement patterns within the NP and beyond.","tags":["u̱t-Maꞌin noun research","Grammar","Nigeria","Kanji"],"title":"u̱t-Maꞌin noun research","type":"project"},{"authors":["Rebecca Paterson"],"categories":["Defense"],"content":"","date":1185886833,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1185886833,"objectID":"4ec1b7b4eda2c8066bfeb03d0055f1bd","permalink":"https://hughandbecky.us/Becky-CV/talk/2007-becky-ma-defense/","publishdate":"2007-04-11T22:00:33Z","relpermalink":"/Becky-CV/talk/2007-becky-ma-defense/","section":"talk","summary":"A presentation and defense of my MA thesis —  *The noun class system of u̱t‑Maꞌin, a West Kainji language of Northwestern Nigeria* .","tags":["Thesis","u̱t‑Maꞌin","Kainji","Nouns","Noun Classes"],"title":"University of North Dakota MA Defense","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Rebecca Paterson"],"categories":["Conference"],"content":"","date":1175040000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1175040000,"objectID":"e3260e1b79d1c65a1f75a3a58da2ef58","permalink":"https://hughandbecky.us/Becky-CV/talk/2007-research-on-umain-noun-classes/","publishdate":"2007-03-28T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/Becky-CV/talk/2007-research-on-umain-noun-classes/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":["Noun classes","u̱t‑Maꞌin","Kainji","Nouns","Grammar"],"title":"Research on u̱t-Ma'in noun classes","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Rebecca Paterson"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1172050223,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1172050223,"objectID":"ab83aa814d3ecc844986091da55e4810","permalink":"https://hughandbecky.us/Becky-CV/publication/2007-thesis/","publishdate":"2007-02-21T01:30:23-08:00","relpermalink":"/Becky-CV/publication/2007-thesis/","section":"publication","summary":"A comprehensive overview of the noun class system of u̱t‑Maꞌin including the morphosyntax of the noun phrase and the use of both prefixes and suffixes on nouns and agreement targets.

I used this list as the basis for my investigation into the noun classes of u̱t‑Maꞌin. I started work in 2005 in Tungun Magajiya. But the list was mostly transcribed, checked and recorded between February 2006 and March 2007 in Jos. A typed version of this wordlist appears as an appendix in my M. A. thesis. I provide here a scan done in 2017 of my hand written work during elicitation. I have audio recordings, but these are not prepared for sharing at this time.\nContext and consent Most of the audio recordings for the 1700 wordlist were made in December 2006 with Sunday John at ELM House, Jos. Sunday’s wife Serah was also present during the checking and recording preparation. Sunday and Serah each signed a consent form stating that the data collected could be used for my MA thesis specifically and that the data could be used for further academic research. Further, they agreed that the recordings themselves could be shared for academic purposes. The data was collected under the University of North Dakota IRB Project # IRB-200601-006\nSunday and Serah are both u̱t‑MaꞌRor speakers, who lived in Tungun Magajiya, Niger State.\nTechnology used Recordings were made on a Mini-disc recorder with proprietary Sony software. The software allowed only one retrieval of the file. That file in its proprietary file format was retrieved and then “converted” to a .wav file. The WAV file was cut into the files for each numerical item of the 1700 wordlist. Audacity was used to cut and save the individual word files.\n Bibliography   Snider\u0026#32;\u0026amp;\u0026#32;Roberts (2006)  Snider,\u0026#32; K.\u0026#32;\u0026amp;\u0026#32;Roberts,\u0026#32; J. \u0026#32; (2006). \u0026#32;SIL comparative African wordlist (SILCAWL).

There are seven distinct sections: an introduction; Wild Dog’s invitation; Spider’s speech; Frog’s speech; Chameleon’s speech; and the final reactions of the other animals. This story is used for a case study\nThis story was composed as an oral story by Ibrahim Tume Ushe sometime before 2005; he provided a handwritten version in the orthography; it was subsequently typed as a Word document. It was also translated into English by Ibrahim Tume Ushe. In 2007, I recorded two versions of the story read from the transcribed text first by Sunday John and a second read by John Ibrahim. I transcribed the text in IPA including tone marking from the 2007 recording and did morpheme-by-morpheme glossing in FLEx. In 2020, I annotated this story for speech constructions using ELAN-CorpA and the Reported speech annotation template for ELAN (Nikitina et al. 2019) for the project Discourse reporting in African storytelling. The annotated text will be available online in early 2021 with the launch of the Discourse Reporting in African Storytelling repository.\nNikitina, Tatiana, Abbie Hantgan, \u0026amp; Christian Chanard. 2019.
