      <description>&lt;p&gt;Over the course of a full academic year 2013-2014, in the context of a doctoral level field methods course sequence, I collected various data from the Moore (Gur) language. Our cohort of 10 doctoral student researchers shared data and analysis over the 9 month period, as we each focussed on slightly different aspects of the language. Data included high-fidelity recordings of wordlists, elicited sentences, (prompted) texts, personal narratives, and other text types. Areas investigated included phonetics, morphology and syntax, applying knowledge of language typology and universals to the elicitation, analysis and evaluation of the data. Dekereke, Fieldworks Language Explorer, and ELAN were used to aid analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
