      <description>&lt;p&gt;Working alongside members of the Pero community from the two principal towns, Gwandum and Filiya, we reviewed previously published linguistic descriptions (1980s) and translated materials (1930s). Their goals included identifying areas for improving the orthography, developing a writing system for the contemporary language, testing that orthography in the community, and translating materials into the Pipero language. We produced a trial version of a transitional literacy book that allowed Pipero speakers who are already literate in Hausa or English to learn the proposed Pipero orthography. We also produced several booklets that were tested by the speaker/translators in their communities. The project continued after my involvement (which ended in 2007) and they have since translated the Gospel of Luke from the Christian New Testament and the and the script of the JESUS film based on the Gospel of Luke. The script was recorded and dubbed to the original English film which can be

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The U̱t-Maꞌin language is characterized by a complex noun classification system and a robust agreement system that permeates the language. While an understanding of the noun classes is essential to an understanding of the language as a whole, discussion includes the division of nouns into fourteen distinct classes, marked by prefixes on the nouns themselves and by agreement elements on other clause constituents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Five of fourteen noun class prefixes are involved in nominalization of the verb; a nominalized verb, along with a goal complement or an object, can be incorporated into the nominalized phrase in the same way that a noun modifier is marked within a NP. These nominalized verb phrases are extensively used in auxiliary constructions that cover a diverse range of tense, aspect, and mode designations; the syntactic transitivity of the clause determines the morphosyntax used. Intransitive auxiliary constructions use the full range of nominalizing noun class marking; in contrast, transitive auxiliary constructions show a shift in their use of the noun class agreement morphology required.&lt;/p&gt;
