      <description>&lt;h4 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SIL comparative African wordlist is a list of words useful in African comparative linguistics (see Snider &amp;amp; Roberts 2004 or 2006). I used this list as the basis for my investigation into the noun classes of u̱t‑Maꞌin. I started work in 2005 in Tungun Magajiya. But the list was mostly transcribed, checked and recorded between February 2006 and March 2007 in Jos. A typed version of this wordlist appears as an appendix in my M. A. thesis.  I provide here a scan done in 2017 of my hand written work during elicitation. I have audio recordings, but these are not prepared for sharing at this time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;context-and-consent&#34;&gt;Context and consent&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the audio recordings for the 1700 wordlist were made in December 2006 with Sunday John at ELM House, Jos. Sunday’s wife Serah was also present during the checking and recording preparation. Sunday and Serah each signed a consent form stating that the data collected could be used for my MA thesis specifically and that the data could be used for further academic research. Further, they agreed that the recordings themselves could be shared for academic purposes. The data was collected under the University of North Dakota IRB Project # IRB-200601-006&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sunday and Serah are both u̱t‑MaꞌRor speakers, who lived in Tungun Magajiya, Niger State.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;technology-used&#34;&gt;Technology used&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recordings were made on a Mini-disc recorder with proprietary Sony software. The software allowed only one retrieval of the file. That file in its proprietary file format was retrieved and then “converted” to a .wav file. The WAV file was cut into the files for each numerical item of the 1700 wordlist. Audacity was used to cut and save the individual word files.&lt;/p&gt;
