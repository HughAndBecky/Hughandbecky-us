      <title>The Gossip King</title>
      <link>https://hughandbecky.us/Becky-CV/publication/2013-the-gossip-king/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 01 Feb 2013 00:09:24 -0800</pubDate>
      <guid>https://hughandbecky.us/Becky-CV/publication/2013-the-gossip-king/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A local king takes it upon himself to right a wrong after hearing about a promiscuous woman. The king approaches the woman’s husband, but he wants to hear none of it. The local king harrasses the husband to the point that the husband takes the entire matter before the high king. The high king then calls the entire chain of gossipers to give testimony as to whether they “saw with their eyes or were they just told” of this promiscuous behavior. In the end, the local king is ordered to seek forgiveness from the husband for his aggressive gossip and harassment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This story was told by Ibrahim Yohanna in a recording made in February 2013 in Tungan Magajiya, Niger State.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was transcribed in the orthography and translated into English by Sunday John via ELAN. Becky Paterson made the IPA transcription including tone marking and did morpheme-by-morpheme glossing and clause level annotation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note&lt;/em&gt;: Some Portions of this text appear in my dissertation.  The audio is unpublished.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Spider, Frog, and Chameleon</title>
      <link>https://hughandbecky.us/Becky-CV/publication/2005-spider-frog-and-chameleon/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 01 Feb 2005 00:09:24 -0800</pubDate>
      <guid>https://hughandbecky.us/Becky-CV/publication/2005-spider-frog-and-chameleon/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The story of Spider, Frog and Chameleon by Ibrahim Tume Ushe demonstrates the artful use of language structures to craft a narrative. There are seven distinct sections: an introduction; Wild Dog’s invitation; Spider’s speech; Frog’s speech; Chameleon’s speech; and the final reactions of the other animals. This story is used for a case study&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This story was composed as an oral story by Ibrahim Tume Ushe sometime before 2005; he provided a handwritten version in the orthography; it was subsequently typed as a Word document. It was also translated into English by Ibrahim Tume Ushe. In 2007, I recorded two versions of the story read from the transcribed text first by Sunday John and a second read by John Ibrahim. I transcribed the text in IPA including tone marking from the 2007 recording and did morpheme-by-morpheme glossing in FLEx. In 2020, I annotated this story for speech constructions using ELAN-CorpA and the Reported speech annotation template for ELAN (Nikitina et al. 2019) for the project Discourse reporting in African storytelling. The annotated text will be available online in early 2021 with the launch of the Discourse Reporting in African Storytelling repository.&lt;/p&gt;
