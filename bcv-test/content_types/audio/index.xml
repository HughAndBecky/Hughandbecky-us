      <title>The Gossip King</title>
      <link>https://hughandbecky.us/bcv-test/publication/2013-the-gossip-king/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 01 Feb 2013 00:09:24 -0800</pubDate>
      <guid>https://hughandbecky.us/bcv-test/publication/2013-the-gossip-king/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A local king takes it upon himself to right a wrong after hearing about a promiscuous woman. The king approaches the woman’s husband, but he wants to hear none of it. The local king harrasses the husband to the point that the husband takes the entire matter before the high king. The high king then calls the entire chain of gossipers to give testimony as to whether they “saw with their eyes or were they just told” of this promiscuous behavior. In the end, the local king is ordered to seek forgiveness from the husband for his aggressive gossip and harassment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This story was told by Ibrahim Yohanna in a recording made in February 2013 in Tungan Magajiya, Niger State.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was transcribed in the orthography and translated into English by Sunday John via ELAN. Becky Paterson made the IPA transcription including tone marking and did morpheme-by-morpheme glossing and clause level annotation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note&lt;/em&gt;: Some Portions of this text appear in my dissertation.  The audio is unpublished.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Over the course of a full academic year 2013-2014, in the context of a doctoral level field methods course sequence, I collected various data from the Moore (Gur) language. Our cohort of 10 doctoral student researchers shared data and analysis over the 9 month period, as we each focussed on slightly different aspects of the language. Data included high-fidelity recordings of wordlists, elicited sentences, (prompted) texts, personal narratives, and other text types. Areas investigated included phonetics, morphology and syntax, applying knowledge of language typology and universals to the elicitation, analysis and evaluation of the data. Dekereke, Fieldworks Language Explorer, and ELAN were used to aid analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>u̱t‑Maꞌin SIL comparative African wordlist</title>
      <link>https://hughandbecky.us/bcv-test/publication/2005-sil-1700-wordlist/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 01 Nov 2005 00:09:24 -0800</pubDate>
      <guid>https://hughandbecky.us/bcv-test/publication/2005-sil-1700-wordlist/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h4 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SIL comparative African wordlist is a list of words useful in African comparative linguistics (see Snider &amp;amp; Roberts 2004 or 2006). I used this list as the basis for my investigation into the noun classes of u̱t‑Maꞌin. I started work in 2005 in Tungun Magajiya. But the list was mostly transcribed, checked and recorded between February 2006 and March 2007 in Jos. A typed version of this wordlist appears as an appendix in my M. A. thesis.  I provide here a scan done in 2017 of my hand written work during elicitation. I have audio recordings, but these are not prepared for sharing at this time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;context-and-consent&#34;&gt;Context and consent&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the audio recordings for the 1700 wordlist were made in December 2006 with Sunday John at ELM House, Jos. Sunday’s wife Serah was also present during the checking and recording preparation. Sunday and Serah each signed a consent form stating that the data collected could be used for my MA thesis specifically and that the data could be used for further academic research. Further, they agreed that the recordings themselves could be shared for academic purposes. The data was collected under the University of North Dakota IRB Project # IRB-200601-006&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sunday and Serah are both u̱t‑MaꞌRor speakers, who lived in Tungun Magajiya, Niger State.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;technology-used&#34;&gt;Technology used&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recordings were made on a Mini-disc recorder with proprietary Sony software. The software allowed only one retrieval of the file. That file in its proprietary file format was retrieved and then “converted” to a .wav file. The WAV file was cut into the files for each numerical item of the 1700 wordlist. Audacity was used to cut and save the individual word files.&lt;/p&gt;
