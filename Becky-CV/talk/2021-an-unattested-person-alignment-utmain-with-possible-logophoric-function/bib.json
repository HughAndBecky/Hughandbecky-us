  {"id":"yohanna_gossip_2013","abstract":"A local king takes it upon himself to right a wrong after hearing about a promiscuous woman. The king approaches the woman’s husband, but he wants to hear none of it. The local king harrasses the husband to the point that the husband takes the entire matter before the high king. The high king then calls the entire chain of gossipers to give testimony as to whether they “saw with their eyes or were they just told” of this promiscuous behavior. In the end, the local king is ordered to seek forgiveness from the husband for his aggressive gossip and harassment.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,9,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Yohanna","given":"Ibrahim"},{"family":"Paterson","given":"Rebecca"}],"event-place":"Tungan Magajiya","genre":"Electronic Manuscript","issued":{"date-parts":[[2013]]},"language":"en","publisher-place":"Tungan Magajiya","source":"hughandbecky.us","title":"The Gossip King // Faru̱k u̱ ke̱t-u̱ ne̱t-u̱t wa u̱s-rem","type":"manuscript","URL":"https://hughandbecky.us/Becky-CV/publication/2013-the-gossip-king"},
