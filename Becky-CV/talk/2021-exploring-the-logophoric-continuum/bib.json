		"abstract": "This study presents a typology of existing approaches to logophoricity and discusses problems the different approaches face. It addresses, in particular, perspective-based accounts describing constructions with logophoric pronouns in terms of their intermediate position on the direct-indirect continuum (Evans 2013), and lexical accounts incorporating the idea of coreference with the reported speaker into the pronoun’s meaning, either through role-to-value mapping mechanisms (Nikitina 2012a, b), or through feature specification ( Schlenker 2003a , b). The perspective-based approach is shown to be unsatisfactory when it comes to  treating language-specific data in precise and cross-linguistically comparable terms. It fails to account, for example, forcross-linguistic differences in the behavior of logophoric pronouns, for their optionality, and for their close diachronic relationship to third person elements. Lexical accounts are better equipped to handle a variety of outstanding issues, but they, too, need to be revised to accommodate a variety of discourse phenomena associated with logophoricity, including alternation with first person pronouns. The proposed solution follows the lines of lexical approaches but aims at enriching the pronouns’ lexical representation with notions pertaining to narrative structure, such as the role of Narrator. A separate solution is proposed for treating conventionalized uses occurring outside speech and attitude reports.",

		"abstract": "The term logophoric is most strongly tied to pronominal systems. However, most recent literature on logophoricity accepts the existence of verbal marking of logophoricity. Through examining the verbal logophoricity which has been reported in African languages, it can be seen that there are three different types of verbal marking: logophoric cross-referencing, first person logophoricity, and verbal logophoric affixation. These different types may appear as the only form of logophoric marking in a language, or they may combine with each other and with logophoric pronouns. Each of these types appears to have distinct properties and, hence, needs to be treated separately in typological literature.",
