      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://sites.google.com/view/speechreporting/home?authuser=0&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Discourse reporting in African storytelling&lt;/a&gt; is a collaborative project hosted at CNRS-LLACAN, Villejuif, France. With 20+ project team members and collaborators, we are interested in traditional oral storytelling practices across West Africa. Specifically, we are investigating the relationship between specific discourse patterns and the linguistic strategies they rely on in quoted speech  and other reported speech environments.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>u̱t-Ma&#39;in verb research</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this study, I investigated the distribution of verb forms and the discourse function of those verb forms in U̱t-Ma&amp;rsquo;in narratives. The primary focus was the use of what I call the “Bare Verb” form for both present/habitual functions and for past time interpretation within the main event line of a narrative discourse. The function of the Bare Verb form is one of interpretive dependence on the discourse context. In this respect the Bare Verb form is similar to some of functions of the null verb form described for Wolof (Atlantic). Due to its textual interpretive dependence, the U̱t-Ma&amp;rsquo;in Bare Verb form never occurs as the first verb of a narrative event sequence, though the clauses it occurs in have all other components of finite main clause syntax (and the Bare Verb can clearly occur independently as the single verb form in a stand-alone utterance). The Bare Verb form is not a case of a grammatical form specifically devoted to narrative sequence; but the U̱t-Ma&amp;rsquo;in language does use sequenced Bare Verb forms as a strategy to further the narrative without need to reset the temporal, aspectual, or mood scenario for the listener (as well as other functions).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Data for this project was collected in collaboration with local speakers. Nine texts were transcribed, glossed, translated and annotated.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Working alongside members of the Pero community from the two principal towns, Gwandum and Filiya, we reviewed previously published linguistic descriptions (1980s) and translated materials (1930s). Their goals included identifying areas for improving the orthography, developing a writing system for the contemporary language, testing that orthography in the community, and translating materials into the Pipero language. We produced a trial version of a transitional literacy book that allowed Pipero speakers who are already literate in Hausa or English to learn the proposed Pipero orthography. We also produced several booklets that were tested by the speaker/translators in their communities. The project continued after my involvement (which ended in 2007) and they have since translated the Gospel of Luke from the Christian New Testament and the&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>u̱t-Ma&#39;in noun research</title>
      <link>https://hughandbecky.us/Becky-CV/project/ut-main-noun-research/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Ut-Ma&amp;rsquo;in language is characterized by a complex noun classification system and a robust agreement system that permeates the language. While an understanding of the noun classes is essential to an understanding of the language as a whole, discussion includes the division of nouns into fourteen distinct classes, marked by prefixes on the nouns themselves and by agreement elements on other clause constituents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Five of fourteen noun class prefixes are involved in nominalization of the verb; a nominalized verb, along with a goal complement or an object, can be incorporated into the nominalized phrase in the same way that a noun modifier is marked within a NP. These nominalized verb phrases are extensively used in auxiliary constructions that cover a diverse range of tense, aspect, and mode designations; the syntactic transitivity of the clause determines the morphosyntax used. Intransitive auxiliary constructions use the full range of nominalizing noun class marking; in contrast, transitive auxiliary constructions show a shift in their use of the noun class agreement morphology required.&lt;/p&gt;
