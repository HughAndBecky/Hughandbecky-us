      <description>Biography I read the language less read. I frequently work with speakers of languages who have historically never written down their language. The speakers I encounter often want to write their language and use it in community functions such as education and religious venues, but have difficult decisions to make as they try something new to them.
I use tools from language documentation and linguistics to create corpora of oral stories.</description>
