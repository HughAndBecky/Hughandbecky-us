However, no data from Kainji languages was included quite likely because very little on Kainji languages has been researched or published. This paper offers data from U̱t‑Maꞌin [[gel](https://iso639-3.sil.org/code/gel)], a Kainji language, spoken in Kebbi State and Niger State, Nigeria. Additional comparative verbal morphology data is presented from closely related languages, C’Lela [[dri](https://iso639-3.sil.org/code/dri)] and U̠t-Hun [[dud](https://iso639-3.sil.org/code/dud)]. U̱t‑Maꞌin employs verbal suffixes, a series of pre-verb auxiliaries and nominalizations to express the various tense and aspect categories of the language. Within the auxiliary paradigm, there is a three way tense distinction: past imperfective, present imperfective and future. The suffixed verb morphology paradigm shows only a two way tense distinction: past versus non-past.\n(1)ɘ̄ mrɛ́ -g-ɘ̄ nsāpɘ  zwɘ̄ g ɘ̄ r1 SG eat- PST - DISTriceLOCZuru.town‘I ate rice in Zuru (before coming here)’\nThe suffixing paradigm expresses additional aspectual meanings for past forms, which include perfective interpretations along with distance (1), affectedness of the object, and exclusiveness of the subject (2), which emphasizes that only the referent of the subject pronoun/noun is capable of or subject to the predicate. To my knowledge, this type of exclusivity of the subject has not been described as a verbal category within an aspect system.\n(2)újɘ̄ n-ɛhɔ̀ g-d-ɘ̀ -mɛ C 1.3 SGleave- EXCLhear- C 5- ASSOC -6 M -shame‘(Only) he left ashamed.’","tags":["Verb","Kainji"],"title":"Verbal categories in U̱t-Ma'in, a Kainji language of Nigeria","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Rebecca Paterson"],"categories":null,"content":"​\n","date":1383609600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1383609600,"objectID":"59a82e43f0470198c6668bb5592980f8","permalink":"https://hughandbecky.us/Becky-CV/talk/2013-formation-of-verbs-in-utmain/","publishdate":"2013-11-05T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/Becky-CV/talk/2013-formation-of-verbs-in-utmain/","section":"talk","summary":"u̱t‑Maꞌin verbs occur with suffixes that display one set of tense/direction distinctions.

Seven retellings were by speakers of the Ror variety (3 women, 4 men). Two retellings in additional varieties were also recorded: 1 male speaker from the northernmost variety, Kuur, and 1 male speaker from the southernmost variety, Juur. A short wordlist was also collected from each speaker.\nEach participant (speaker A) watched the Pear Film video, then a second speaker (speaker B) prompted speaker A by asking the question “What did you see in the video?” or “Tell me what happened.” Speaker A then told what they recalled from the video to speaker B who had not yet seen the video. The interactions, which proved to be dynamic, were recorded in audio and video.\nThese retellings were added to my ongoing research on u̱t‑Maꞌin grammar in order to better understand differences that may exist across speakers and language varieties. The “Retelling” genre also emerged as distinct from other narratives (folk/proverbial and personal). For example, all nine retellings made use of a patterned tail-head linkage that is not attested in folk narratives or personal narratives.\nNo Pear Film retellings were collected for the Us, Zuksun, or Fer varieties.

The primary focus was the use of what I call the “Bare Verb” form for both present/habitual functions and for past time interpretation within the main event line of a narrative discourse. The function of the Bare Verb form is one of interpretive dependence on the discourse context. In this respect the Bare Verb form is similar to some of functions of the null verb form described for Wolof (Atlantic). Due to its textual interpretive dependence, the U̱t-Maꞌin Bare Verb form never occurs as the first verb of a narrative event sequence, though the clauses it occurs in have all other components of finite main clause syntax (and the Bare Verb can clearly occur independently as the single verb form in a stand-alone utterance). The Bare Verb form is not a case of a grammatical form specifically devoted to narrative sequence; but the U̱t-Maꞌin language does use sequenced Bare Verb forms as a strategy to further the narrative without need to reset the temporal, aspectual, or mood scenario for the listener (as well as other functions).\nData for this project was collected in collaboration with local speakers.

While an understanding of the noun classes is essential to an understanding of the language as a whole, discussion includes the division of nouns into fourteen distinct classes, marked by prefixes on the nouns themselves and by agreement elements on other clause constituents.\nFive of fourteen noun class prefixes are involved in nominalization of the verb; a nominalized verb, along with a goal complement or an object, can be incorporated into the nominalized phrase in the same way that a noun modifier is marked within a NP. These nominalized verb phrases are extensively used in auxiliary constructions that cover a diverse range of tense, aspect, and mode designations; the syntactic transitivity of the clause determines the morphosyntax used. Intransitive auxiliary constructions use the full range of nominalizing noun class marking; in contrast, transitive auxiliary constructions show a shift in their use of the noun class agreement morphology required.\n","date":1186763422,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1186763422,"objectID":"5c2b0d2f578ee20aa3141e5fb2c9afde","permalink":"https://hughandbecky.us/Becky-CV/project/ut-main-noun-research/","publishdate":"2007-08-10T09:30:22-07:00","relpermalink":"/Becky-CV/project/ut-main-noun-research/","section":"project","summary":"Complex morphology and agreement patterns within the NP and beyond.","tags":["u̱t-Maꞌin noun research","Grammar","Nigeria","Kainji"],"title":"u̱t-Maꞌin noun research","type":"project"},{"authors":["Rebecca Paterson"],"categories":["Defense"],"content":"","date":1185886833,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1185886833,"objectID":"4ec1b7b4eda2c8066bfeb03d0055f1bd","permalink":"https://hughandbecky.us/Becky-CV/talk/2007-becky-ma-defense/","publishdate":"2007-04-11T22:00:33Z","relpermalink":"/Becky-CV/talk/2007-becky-ma-defense/","section":"talk","summary":"A presentation and defense of my MA thesis —  *The noun class system of u̱t‑Maꞌin, a West Kainji language of Northwestern Nigeria* .","tags":["Thesis","u̱t‑Maꞌin","Kainji","Nouns","Noun Class"],"title":"University of North Dakota MA Defense","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Rebecca Paterson"],"categories":["Conference"],"content":"","date":1175040000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1175040000,"objectID":"6bb38ba1780f1f67ec044a9b45ef6967","permalink":"https://hughandbecky.us/Becky-CV/talk/2007-research-on-utmain-noun-classes/","publishdate":"2007-03-28T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/Becky-CV/talk/2007-research-on-utmain-noun-classes/","section":"talk","summary":"A first look at the u̱t-Ma'in noun class system: noun affixes and agreement morphology.
